<p>How do you develop  a consistent yoga practice at home?</p>
<p>We are certainly living in extraordinary times right now. Every single one of us has had to adapt to a new temporary way of life as we try and stay safe during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Many of my students work for the NHS. When I catch myself in a grump, frustrated that I can’t see friends for a cheeky vino or attend a family BBQ, I think of them. Staying home really is a small ask in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my life is pretty well-equipped to deal with self-isolation. I don’t have children so no need to don my teacher’s hat. Working from home for me is normal and my yoga practice is 98% a home practice. I enjoy solitary walks outside and so far I’m enjoying my partner being at home all the time. I do miss my family and friends though. That makes my heart hurt a bit. Thank goodness for Zoom and House Party.</p>
<p>Many have used this time to get those jobs ticked off the ‘to-do’ list, improve their homes, unleash their creativity, learn a musical instrument or even learn a language.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>While I applaud that motivation with as much vivacity as my <a href="https://clapforourcarers.co.uk">8pm applause</a> on Thursdays, I can’t help but feel this is all a bit ‘New Years’ Resolutiony’ for the rest of us.</p>
<p>These are strange times and for many, the days can roll into one, routine can be challenging and #selfisolation goals can make us feel even worse if <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2020/01/to-quit-or-not-to-quit/">we don’t accomplish them</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need some reassurance, and perhaps that reassurance needs to be a little more helpful than ‘you are not alone’. You do not need to conquer the world right now.</p>
<p>Use this time to connect…to yourself.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to start a home yoga practice, or a time you needed it more.</p>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/shop"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>With more online yoga than ever before, you don’t have to look far to find live classes. Every day you can find something from all of your favourite teachers. But even this can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>We have put together a few ways to help you get started with a home practice. Take this opportunity to focus on your well-being, boost your motivation and perhaps find some peace in all this craziness.</p>
<h3><strong>Do Not Disturb</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1043 " src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="279" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg 218w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-873x1200.jpg 873w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-800x1100.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb.jpg 945w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" />Make sure that you create a space for your practice where you will not be disturbed. Treat this time, similar to if you were about to take a long, relaxing soak in the tub.</p>
<p>Even though you are practising in your own home, you need to imagine you are attending your usual class. I think this is where most people struggle with a home practice.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to check your phone and get distracted because the environment isn’t set up for you to get your zen on. Usually everywhere we look in our homes, there is something (or someone) that requires our attention.</p>
<p>As best you can, try and set up a small space of tranquility. This is you time, and you want to be able to create the most authentic yoga space you can.</p>
<h3><strong>Make time</strong></h3>
<p>So many <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/">online schedules</a> are available right now, which makes it alot easier to work into your schedule. Apply the same mindset to <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. Just because it isn&#8217;t live, you still need to consciously set time aside to do it. Pop a slot in the diary and make that extra effort to incorporate the classes into your daily routine.</p>
<p>It is important you approach online classes with the same attitude as an ‘in person’ class. This really works for me and helps keep my motivation.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1047" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1200x803.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-800x535.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you are working from home, it can be all too easy to fall into the same pattern. Working through lunch breaks and pattering away at your keyboard for more hours than you should. You still need to take time out and have the breaks that you would normally when working in an office.</p>
<p>Taking an online class will also help to break up the monotony of the day. At the moment, it can feel like each day rolls into the next. Whether you schedule in a live class or a pre-recorded session, both are fantastic opportunities to create variety to ‘samey’ days.</p>
<p>I like to do my practice a couple of hours after my breakfast, and then after some admin and email checking, I’m ready for something yummy for lunch and then I power through work until dinner. For me, that schedule works really well for my routine and allows me to be motivated throughout the day and be more productive. Make a commitment and then the next time you set a time for your practice it will be even easier to stick to.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove any expectations</strong></h3>
<p>So you didn’t do a full 90 minute class and when you did, your online food delivery arrived and the postman called. The kids need your attention and the office has scheduled a Skype call over lunch. So what? Beating yourself up about it isn’t going to make you feel any better.</p>
<p>Life happens. Distractions happen.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1052 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The intention to show up on your mat and make the time is a massive deal.  Just a few minutes in Child’s Pose (Balasana) or even taking 5 minutes in a seated meditation can be enough to reconnect.</p>
<p>When the day runs away from me and I haven’t done anything, you can usually find me on my mat in a supported Fish pose. I personally hold a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders, so this posture works wonders for me when time is short.</p>
<p>Find a pose that helps you relax and open up the body. There is always tomorrow for a Power Rocket class.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep it simple</strong></h3>
<p>This kind of follows on from the point above.</p>
<p>You don’t need a complicated yoga schedule right now. What would you like to work on to improve your practice?</p>
<p>I have one lovely student who keeps requesting hip openers for virtual classes. Usually, I would be like, sweets come on you gotta mix things up a bit! For now, I refrain from suggesting anything of the sort. That&#8217;s what makes her feel good right now, then who am I to tell her she should be doing backbends. Indulge in something that will help you rock up on your mat &#8211; even if it is hip opener after hip opener. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-938 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg" alt="Pyjama Yoga Online Classes Sida Yoga Evening Relaxation Calm Meditation Namaste StayAtHome" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Perhaps you want to take more time to relax, or maybe you would like to try a new style of yoga.</p>
<p>I’ve recently enjoyed discovering new styles myself thanks to virtual yoga. This is a great time to try something new. However, it is easy to get overwhelmed with choices. Try not to set yourself an impossible to-do list of yoga classes. Hone in on what you want from a practice. For me, I love alignment so Anusara is a good fit. I&#8217;ve always fancied having a go at Rocket yoga, and virtual classes have made these new styles possible to try. </p>
<p>Figure out what you want from your home practice and find the programs to suit your personal goals and requirements. That way, you aren’t just doing a class because you feel you have to. You are literally following the path of self improvement and that will make you feel so much better inside and out.</p>
<h3><strong>Join an online class or find a course</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>Use this opportunity to connect with your favourite teachers. I have been fortunate enough to practise yoga in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, China, USA and more&#8230; I&#8217;ve found wonderful teachers who I always make the effort to see whenever I am in the country. Today I can connect with every single one of them thanks to virtual classes, which is something I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>As I connect more with yogi friends I have met all over the world, I’m finding the virtual support and shares really fantastic.</p>
<p>I’ve actually really enjoyed teaching online and will probably continue some of the classes when the self isolation rules are lifted.</p>
<p>For me it’s been a lovely way to connect with my students and I’ve enjoyed the challenge of finding simpler alignment cues that don’t necessarily need me to be there in person. As a teacher it’s been more physically demanding as well – particularly with the stronger vinyasa classes.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t a substitute for actual interaction with a person. However, the current situation has actually been a really special learning experience. For me, it’s much more efficient to use these times as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than wither and wallow. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>If all else fails, shake your booty</strong></h3>
<figure id="attachment_1059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1059" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1059 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1059" class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<p>So your brand new yoga mat is still in its packaging. Your new #workoutathome yoga pants still have the labels attached. The online yoga course you bought still hasn&#8217;t been used and you are ready to give up.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter. It really doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Put on those fabulous new star print yoga leggings and shake that cute booty while you make a cup of tea. Laugh at yourself.</p>
<p>Ask Alexa to play your favourite track and dance like no one is watching. I promise it will make you feel better.</p>
<p>Yoga isn&#8217;t going anywhere and you don&#8217;t have to conquer the world right now. All you need to do to be a superhero is stay at home. </p>
<p>Peace and love yogis xox</p>
<p> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing a yoga mat is as personal as choosing a watch or a new pair of shoes (in my opinion).</p>
<p>A number of factors determine which one you buy, whether that be budget, eco-friendly manufacturing procedures or grip.</p>
<p>I look for two main things when purchasing a yoga mat. I need really good grip (I do get my sweat on), and I need it to wear well, although this isn&#8217;t as important as grip.</p>
<p>My first &#8216;proper&#8217; yoga mat was a Lululemon mat and I still recommend those mats to clients. During my teacher training back in 2015 one of my friends had a Liforme Mat. I marvelled at the AlignForMe<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> system and must admit I had mat envy, but I almost choked on my tea when I learnt the price. It was more than twice what I paid for mine and I dismissed getting one immediately.</p>
<p>Roll on two years later and a generous visit from Santa Claus and hey presto I had one and I was over the moon. </p>
<p>I wanted to review this mat for you, as I get many students ask me about what mat I use and the <a href="https://liforme.com/products/liforme-yoga-mat-grey">Liforme mat</a> is my go-to for my daily home practice. It was good timing too, as I had just bought a new one so we could compare and contrast the wear and tear as well.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>THE GRIP IS AMAZING</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The grip on my Liforme mat is just brilliant and I&#8217;ve put this bad boy through its paces. It&#8217;s been to countless hot yoga classes and even a 3 hour workshop in a hot room my trusty mat never failed. I absolutely love this mat for arm balancing and inversions as I feel a bit more supported. Even if I am sweating, I still feel safe balancing on my hands.</p>
<p>The grip is so good, it can take some time to get used to for Vinyasa, especially Chaturanga to Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana. This doesn&#8217;t bother me especially, but could niggle hard core Ashtangis in the beginning.</p>

<h6><em><strong>THE ALIGNFORME<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> SYSTEM </strong></em></h6>

</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-853" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme3-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" />This is perfect for a beginner or someone who does the majority of their <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">yoga practice at home</a>. It has been meticulously designed for all sorts of body shapes and heights, but make sure you don&#8217;t fall victim to the &#8216;all the gear no idea&#8217; syndrome. Even with the markers, you need to use them according to your body.</p>
<p>I use the hand markers slightly differently to the recommendations as I like using the lower hand marker to align my wrists. This works really nicely for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful feature is the central line. Admittedly there is nothing stopping you taking a <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2016/03/alignment-connection-rather-than-correction/">sharpie to your standard mat</a>, but people tend to be less than keen to deface their stuff. </p>
<p>I personally love this <a href="https://liforme.com/pages/align-for-me">system</a>. When used correctly it can help with a really safe and steady practice when you don&#8217;t have access to adjustment. The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">Coronavirus</a> outbreak means I am only verbal cuing in my classes and avoiding physical adjustment, so if there was ever a time to buy this mat, it&#8217;s now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>BIODEGRADABLE &amp; PVC FREE</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Liforme have spent a lot of time, money and effort to produce a high-quality, eco-friendly mat. It&#8217;s PVC-free and apparently biodegrades in landfill within 1-5 years, which is actually brilliant. It&#8217;s non-toxic and doesn&#8217;t have that horrid &#8216;new mat&#8217; smell when you first open it up.</p>
<p>I love this and it&#8217;s nice to know my yoga practice and slight mat purchasing addiction isn&#8217;t ruining the planet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>LARGER THAN A STANDARD MAT</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually didn&#8217;t realise that the Liforme mats were slightly longer and wider than standard yoga mats. This is great if you are taller than average. A quick Google search tells me the standard mat measures about 172 cm long and 60cm wide. Liforme mats measure 185cm long and 68cm wide so that&#8217;s some significant inch gain right there.</p>
<p>If you are super tall like my fella, you may want to look at a mat that has been designed accordingly. <a href="https://eu.manduka.com/products/manduka-pro-yoga-mat?variant=30199675256883">Manduka</a> offer a mat for sale that measures up to 215cm long which is ideal for tall folks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>CHARITY DONATIONS</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love a company that gives back? By purchasing from their <a href="https://liforme.com/collections/giving-back">Purple Earth, White Magic or Zodiac</a> range, a percentage of profits goes to <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk">Friends of the Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk">RSPCA</a>.</p>
<h3>CONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>PRICEY</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cheapest standard yoga mat available is currently £80 as Liforme are offering a discount until tomorrow. This is definitely on the pricier end of the mat-buying spectrum, and those that have a strict budget might not be able to justify the higher price tag. Perhaps you only attend one or two classes a week and just won&#8217;t get the &#8216;value-for-use&#8217;.</p>
<p>Personally, I think you get what you pay for. I use my mat everyday so I need the best mat I can afford. The Liforme mats are worth every penny in my opinion, but if too pricey look for offers throughout the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>ANT FOOD</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These mats are basically chocolate pudding for ants! They are biodegradable which is awesome, but when using outside they attract the bugs.</p>
<p>Last October I took my Liforme mat with me to a stunning Shala where it was all open plan &#8211; think at one with nature. However, it didn&#8217;t take long for my mat to attract any creepy crawly within walking distance. </p>
<p>It did affect me a bit as I was forever swatting and pushing them off my mat which was a little annoying. At first, I couldn&#8217;t work out why I was an ant-magnet. Then I noticed my originally-pristine mat was now pretty damaged as the result of a Mad Anter&#8217;s Tea Party.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I&#8217;d rather have a planet-friendly mat than be too bothered about the damage but it is a bit of a bugger when you think how much the mats are in the first place.</p>
<p>My damaged one will now be my dedicated outdoor mat for the summer, as I now have a spare. If you only have one mat, consider using something else outside or use super strong insect repellant. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>WEARS AND ATTRACTS MARKS</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the Manduka mats I have purchased, the Liforme mats wear a little more. Personally, I still think the wearing out is pretty excellent and as I buy the grey mats I don&#8217;t notice the dirt as much. </p>
<p>Liforme have just launched a <a href="https://liforme.com/products/liforme-white-magic-mat">White Magic mat</a>, which is simply a stunning work of art. I do however worry about how this mat might look in a few months time. Although, having said that, the team at Liforme have taken measures to reduce this issue so I guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>Personally I love black and I clean my mat religiously so it&#8217;s not a huge issue for me, but the Mrs Hinch wannabes might struggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><strong><em>BAG STRAP IS UNCOMFORTABLE</em></strong></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-863" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme5-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></em></strong><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Although the bag is complimentary, I&#8217;m not really a fan. Where they have placed the clip fastening for me is extremely uncomfortable. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">How I carry the bag, this clip sits right on my shoulder and it just digs in. Maybe I have super sensitive shoulders, but I&#8217;d rather the clip be the other end as the padding is fixed so I can&#8217;t move it. </span></p>
<p>To be honest, this is my home practice mat and I only really take it out the house for workshops or trainings, so again not a huge issue for me, but could annoy those with sensitive shoulders &#8211; like me.</p>
<p>The bag is also complimentary with the mat purchase but I wanted to mention it as it is annoying.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>ONLY ONE THICKNESS (4.2mm)</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">If you are super sensitive on the knees or joints, the 4.2mm thickness on these mats </span><em style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">might </em><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">not be enough for you.</span></p>
<p>Personally, if you suffer from knee sensitivity, I would suggest buying separate knee pads anyway. A small towel or blanket can also do the job here. </p>
<p>However, if you don&#8217;t want to be buying extra kit, you may want to look at thicker mats available. The cushioning on the Liforme mats is great, but I don&#8217;t suffer from pain in my knees so it&#8217;s difficult to advise here. If you need more padding though, Manduka do offer 6mm thick mats as well as a whopping 8mm thick yoga mat. </p>
<h3>OVERALL</h3>
<p>8.5-9/10</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-865" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-300x253.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-1200x1012.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-1536x1295.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-2048x1727.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-800x674.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ve only deducted points for the ant issue, price and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t wear as well as other mats I&#8217;ve bought.</p>
<p>However, this is THE mat I will always recommend especially if you love alignment, inversions and arm balancing.</p>
<p>The grip is insanely good and if you mainly have a home practice, it is a must-buy. Plus, it&#8217;s also nice to know that my practice isn&#8217;t damaging the planet &#8211; a few ants here and there is a small sacrifice I guess 😉</p>

<p><img class="alignright wp-image-828 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/be-kind-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/be-kind-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/be-kind-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/be-kind-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/be-kind.jpg 591w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This isn’t another article preaching about how we all need to be kind to one another. In truth, I’ve had enough of it plastered all over my social media. Isn&#8217;t this common sense for most people?<br />
I actually find it bizarre that we now need to see this phrase in 2020, acting as a reminder of a very simple life lesson we all should have learnt by primary school.</p>
<p>However, even though most of us know that we should all be good to our fellow man, we all slip up occasionally. We aren&#8217;t perfect. It&#8217;s easy to get consumed by our own lives and the trials and tribulations that get thrown at us can often make us forget to look out for one another. Some of us might not even have the capacity or mental energy to do so. We can get frustrated and lash out and say and do things we regret later.</p>
<p>When I feel tested in this area, I begin by stopping myself from judging others. This is different from the &#8216;be kind&#8217; mantra. In times of stress or in difficult moments it has stopped me doing the opposite and being rude in a situation that just doesn&#8217;t serve me.<br />
We are all judgemental. We voluntarily give unwelcome opinions especially if someone doesn&#8217;t agree with us. Take the dreaded Brexit debacle. That shit made families fall out and in some cases not speak to each other for months. To be honest, it&#8217;s why I keep politics off my social media and mute anyone that tries to dictate how I should or shouldn&#8217;t vote. I&#8217;m capable of deciding myself thanks!</p>
<p>Look back at a time when you were really judgemental. Would you say those things to someone&#8217;s face? If so, for what end result? Sometimes if you have nothing nice to say, it&#8217;s better to say nothing at all.<br />
After all, comments can hurt. Judging someone&#8217;s appearance, ability or work can ruin someone&#8217;s day. How would you feel? Is it necessary to vocalise your negative opinions outside of your friendship group? I don&#8217;t think so. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bullying-social-media-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="3127" height="959" /><br />
I think at the point where nasty comments can force people to delete social media accounts, and quite often much worse, we need to look at what we say to and about others. This is the beginning, before we do anything above what is considered a standard level of respect.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not saying let&#8217;s never criticise one another. People these days already seem way too sensitive. Constructive criticism can be really helpful, but outright insults are just unnecessary and can sometimes leave wounds that take a lot longer to heal.</p>
<p>A world where we all have freedom of speech and a platform we can spew out our personal and political opinions, sometimes brings out the worst in us.</p>
<h4>Yoga can be judgemental too </h4>
<p>Even in the yoga world, people are quick to voice their opinions. ‘That’s not yoga, it’s gymnastics’ and ‘you can’t be a yogi if you eat meat’ or ‘yoga is dangerous’. I’ve often seen these comments online, especially if the post shows a seemingly impossible pose by an extremely svelte and beautiful person.<br />
People can be so quick to judge. Thankfully the majority of comments on these posts are positive. However, there is always one person who seems intent to give five cents and not in the form of constructive criticism but by just being downright bitchy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-838 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/yoga-poses-blog-be-kind-don-t-judge.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/yoga-poses-blog-be-kind-don-t-judge.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/yoga-poses-blog-be-kind-don-t-judge-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/yoga-poses-blog-be-kind-don-t-judge-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Admittedly, I do sometimes feel intimidated by other yogis who can do the crazy advanced stuff I&#8217;m nowhere near accomplishing yet. It can be easy to compare and basically feel crap about yourself. I try to apply the same thought process that I apply to a yoga class. There will always be someone that can do something you can&#8217;t. There will be someone more flexible and someone who is stronger. The reality is I need to focus on <em>my </em>journey and mine alone. Regardless of ability, the reality is even the most basic asana takes <em>alot </em>of work to get &#8216;right&#8217;. If you can stand on one hand with your legs tied around your head then kudos &#8211; you probably worked your ass off to get there.</p>
<p>Even yoga brands fall victim to the online abuse. Calls to boycott a brand for using slim models in the snow, or the fact that a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5782923/Nutritionist-slams-Sweaty-Betty-slogan-reads-no-ache-no-cake.html">slogan on a sweatshirt</a> might rub someone up the wrong way.</p>
<p>On one side, people are encouraging others to be kind, but on the other, we often offer our judgements with more authority than we should. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-843 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meditation-651411_1920-300x232.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="232" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meditation-651411_1920-300x232.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meditation-651411_1920-1200x927.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meditation-651411_1920-1536x1186.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meditation-651411_1920-800x618.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meditation-651411_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />From my perspective the yoga community should always be a welcoming and safe place for all, but sometimes that isn’t the case.<br />
Often, I hear stories from my non-yogi friends of how they once tried a yoga class but were put off by self-righteous environments, whether that be from teachers or the students themselves. After such an unpleasant experience they never ever go back, assuming all classes are the same. It’s such a pity, and perhaps if their experience hadn’t been so toxic and judgemental, they would have fallen in love with the practice as much as I have and reaping the <a href="http://www.sidayoga.com/#benefits">benefits</a>.</p>
<h4>You do you</h4>
<p>I have to admit, I rarely come across an arsehole in yoga. Every training I have ever done, I am moved to tears by the end at both my sadness that it’s over and my jubilation at having met such yogi rock stars.<br />
Now and again, of course someone rubs me up the wrong way (I’m normal), and I’m sure vice versa but I try not to judge. This for me is where the first step of being kind to one another starts.<br />
Ever remember your mother saying to you ‘if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything at all’? Couple that with ‘only valuing the opinions of people you respect’. The result is a superpower of feeling mentally invincible.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-846 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blog-be-kind-dont-judge2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blog-be-kind-dont-judge2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blog-be-kind-dont-judge2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blog-be-kind-dont-judge2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
To quote Shakespeare ‘All the world’s a stage’. We are all actors performing in some way. Especially with the likes of social media (#livingmybestlife <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f644.png" alt="🙄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).<br />
As the audience we are too hasty to fill the role of critic.<br />
Perhaps all that negative energy could be used differently – for good rather than evil.<br />
Try your best not to be that judgemental person. After all, you don’t really have the right to.</p>
<p>You do you – work on that first and I’ll do the same. Then you never know, perhaps by default we all just might live in a kinder world anyway.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg" alt="green meadow, inner peace" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1071495136-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As a yoga teacher I hear and see this all the time; &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing that&#8217; or &#8216;My legs/torso/arms/(insert other here) are too short/long&#8217;. Or, I get the quiet ones who just tend to look at me in horror waiting for the challenge to be over and we move on to something more accessible.</p>
<p>Unless you have an injury or a similar reason for not being able to do the posture or challenge, then I always expect my students to at least give it a go. &#8216;Just try&#8217; I say.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-735 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-848216056-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Sometimes students fall or lose balance and I smile and say &#8216;That&#8217;s awesome! That shows me you went for it&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t try, you will be forever stuck where you are, unable to progress and running away from challenges rather than facing them. I try to encourage my students to take what they learn on the mat, away with them off the mat. If what you learnt from your class that day was to stick your head in the stand and shy away from a posture then that&#8217;s not really what I want you to take away from my class. I want you to feel empowered, strong and wanting to do more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-745 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png 290w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1158x1200.png 1158w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-800x829.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920.png 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>I also HATE the word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; in an asana practice. Instead, I explain to my class&#8230;it&#8217;s just &#8216;not yet&#8217;. This is the mantra I try to repeat as often as possible to those students who just feel stuck and run away. I find this re-phrasing tends to resonate with people more than me putting my strict teacher face on. I like to give an example of something that they can do today that they couldn&#8217;t do before. The simplest example I can think of is walking. We cannot walk from birth, this is something we learn to do. It may take us 9 months to a year (or even longer) of falling on our backsides before we take our first steps, but it happens with time and patience, and it&#8217;s really as simple as that.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to asanas you currently find impossible to achieve. We live in a world where many of us want instant gratification and quite often, we don&#8217;t want to put in the hard work required to nail the posture. What&#8217;s even worse is when it can take years to make even the smallest shift to progress.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, some students can take the &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach. &#8216;I can&#8217;t get there right now so why bother?&#8217; </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-753 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
It can feel disheartening when you can&#8217;t yet do something. Especially when the shape looks simple enough. It&#8217;s very easy to take the &#8216;can&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do&#8217; route, when I can guarantee there is a possible path to the posture that will work for you right now. Take the modifications and make use of props and yoga toys to make yourself feel supported in the posture. Find <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">tutorials online</a> to help give you ideas on how you can make a posture more accessible. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-749 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1171447238-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Something that one of my favourite yogis <a href="https://www.elvisgarciayoga.com">Elvis Garcia</a> mentioned in one of his online classes I took years ago, still sticks with me today; &#8216;Any part of the pose is still the pose&#8217;. I absolutely LOVE this and it&#8217;s so so true. Let&#8217;s take the example of Bakasana (Crow pose). Even working on lifting your hips higher from Malasana pose while you plant the hands is still <em>part</em> of the pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feet stay on the ground or not. We are training our bodies into the shape of the posture and working our muscle memory so we get one step closer to our goal. You can still engage the bandhas and find the correct protraction of the shoulders even with the feet firmly planted on the ground. Sitting on your butt and willing the moment to pass, <i>isn&#8217;t </i>part of the pose and you will never get there in a month of Sundays. If something is holding you back figure out what that is and work with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s a fear of falling in which case <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sidayoga/videos/1652540961451389/">pad the space around you</a> with as many pillows you can find, and then just fall. A soft landing with arm balances can really help take the fear out of the attempt, which might be the very thing holding you back.</p>
<p>I am a curvy girl with boobs and I&#8217;ve had teachers tell me some postures will never be in my repertoire. Well poo to that! Certain postures might not come as easy to me as others, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up. I&#8217;m going to work with the goods God gave me and make it work, and you know what &#8211; this hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>Get out of your head. Just because thousands of people on Instagram can do that handstand you can&#8217;t quite nail yet, don&#8217;t be under any illusion. They probably had to work their a$$es off to get there. Strength drills, flexibility exercises, shoulder opening and dedication&#8230;every day. That famous yoga <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yogaeverydamnday/?hl=en">hashtag</a> exists for a reason!</p>
<p>And guys and gals please&#8230; there is NO SUCH THING AS CAN&#8217;T &#8211; just NOT YET!</p>
<p>Start thinking like Frodo and get your Fellowship together and start that long journey. Just like the Fellowship, you will have some serious hurdles to climb, and perhaps you will often feel like giving up, but commit yourself to the process. You won&#8217;t save Middle Earth, but I can guarantee you will feel incredible when you eventually realise the goals that you feel are impossible today. In fact, the longer the journey, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when you finally get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Here is my advice on how to <del>save Middle Earth</del> get one step closer to your asana goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAKE THE MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teacher offers a variation to a challenging pose, try it. There is no requirement to shoot and score the pose the first try. Feel it out. Maybe grab your blocks and a strap and see how the props can help with the pose. Try not to rely on them too much, particularly in the example of using the wall for inversions &#8211; it&#8217;s very easy to get to a place where your best friend and crutch turns into something you rely on too much and again you can become stuck, or get used to incorrect alignment which can cause injury.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF THE POSE</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-756 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/handstand-preop-with-block-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Is the posture one that opens up the shoulders? Or perhaps it&#8217;s completely focused on the core. In which case, take some time to practice drills that will build strength or open up the body in those areas. If you are even attempting arm balancing you should be warming up your wrists before you bear weight on your hands. Look at what the pose is asking from you and then do some extra homework to make the goal pose that little bit more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yoga-pose-plank-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Progress may happen quickly or slowly but however long it takes, take the time to check in and look at how far you have come. Maybe you are managing a kick up handstand to the wall now, after starting at zero. Perhaps holding plank pose for those extra 10 seconds is alot more doable. This is all progress and looking at how far you have come gives you a good indication of how far you have to go and makes the end goal way more realistic. </p>
<ul>
<li>CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanumanasana (full splits) for example takes time. You need open hip flexors and hamstrings and quite often these areas are a tight spot for many people, especially if you are an athlete. As the body gradually opens the more you practice, take a moment to celebrate every time you get closer and closer to the full posture. Celebrate and take joy in every miracle millimetre. It&#8217;s a good reminder that it&#8217;s the journey that matters not the destination.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>That would be a hard…no. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, I was bed-ridden with the flu. You know you have the flu if you spot a £50 note on the floor and simply don’t have the capacity to even think about picking it up. I spent most of my time in my pyjamas in bed feeling very sorry for myself. My body ached, my throat was coarse and my ears were beyond painful.</p>
<p>Two days into flu-gate and I really didn’t feel like I was getting any better despite the R&amp;R and polishing off the best part of a bottle of Benylin (or maybe it was 3 bottles!).</p>
<p>I was also getting increasingly frustrated that I couldn’t do my daily practice, but in truth even if I had managed to pull on my yoga pants I wouldn’t have gotten very far after that.</p>
<p>I of course cancelled all my classes but was certainly feeling the withdrawal symptoms of a physical personal practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-709 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I finally did start feeling a bit better, I decided to roll out the mat and take it easy. Some restorative Yin and Yoga Nidra is just what the doctor ordered – only it really wasn’t. I wasn’t feeling nearly as bad as I had previously, but my nose was still blocked and my throat still sore, so forget any consistent breathing.</p>
<p>It felt just…..wrong. Being unable to breathe properly just made me feel really disconnected from my practice, and just rubbish.</p>
<p>I could just about manage a half decent Yoga Nidra practice but to be honest I think that was the medication. Sniffling and coughing your way through even the shortest of meditations just doesn’t have the desired effect and can often make you feel worse.</p>
<p>When you are ill you really need to think twice about attending your regular class.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me when I am feeling unwell or if I am injured – stopping. My practice these days is so disciplined, I just cannot turn it off even if my body forces me to do so. Yes I am sick and yes everything hurts but the worst part is not being able to roll out my mat.</p>
<p>Yoga literally means ‘to yoke’ and to ‘unite’, and when we have a physical practice, a Pranayama practice or meditation session, if we cannot unite our breath with our movement and struggle with our inhales and exhales, then we really have an important ingredient missing from the entire process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-713" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Yet still I have students that attend class when they feel under the weather and even have clients who will still keep their private appointment despite coughing and spluttering the moment I arrive. My group classes are particularly physical, so this really is a bad move if you are not feeling 100%.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-715" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1200x955.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1536x1222.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-800x637.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I’ve had sick students dash out of the room to grab tissues and don’t even get me started on the consequences of Nadi Shodhana on a poorly students’ nasal passages !(gross emoji?)</p>
<p>When you cannot breathe you cannot unite your breath with your movement and your practice then isn’t yoga anymore, it is something else, something more forced and strained and well, unpleasant.</p>
<p>Even if you try a restorative class or a meditation class, our bodies feel heavy and achy, and our minds clouded when we are ill, and quite often you can leave a class feeling worse than before which is the exact opposite of what we are aiming for when we practice yoga.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the reality is, you are full of germs. Think of other people in the class, while we all like to spread the love in our practice that doesn’t extend to your lurgy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="338" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-300x85.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-800x225.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
In gym environments with air conditioning or heated yoga studios this is an environment where germs spread and multiply. Your teacher doesn’t want to catch a cold and neither do your fellow students. When you feel a cold coming on, consider others and skip practice. Respect one another.</p>
<p>I once attended a studio where students were politely asked to leave if they were unwell – and I was really grateful for that rule. As I am my own boss I lose income if I am sick so I try to be extra cautious and while I am sure the sick student wasn’t thrilled at being turned away from class, I was pleased that the studio looked out for its members and teachers. After all they also lose money if they have to cancel a class owing to a teacher being ill. Of course it’s not all about money but it’s most definitely a factor here and it can be frustrating if occasional bouts of illness could be avoided if people were a little more considerate.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-721 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg 281w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1126x1200.jpg 1126w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1441x1536.jpg 1441w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-800x853.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" />B.K.S Iyengar recommends a number of asanas to try when experiencing a variety of different ailments and diseases in his book; <em>Light on Yoga.</em> This handy appendix has often been my go-to when I get students come to me with various issues and problems, but these prescribed asanas do not extend to flu or colds.</p>
<p>If we were supposed to practice asana when full of flu I can’t help but feel Iyengar would have included them in his yoga bible.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor by any stretch but when you are ill, this is your body’s way of telling you to rest and you need to focus on getting better rather than pushing yourself into a practice that could do more damage than good and even prolong the time it takes for you to get better. It’s just common sense.</p>
<p>Hydrate by drinking lots of fluids and consult your pharmacist for some good over-the-counter medication before resorting to anti-biotics. I personally swear by lemon, honey and ginger, herbal teas and Echinacea as well as my trusty bottle of Benylin (always read the label). First thing’s first – look after yourself with a lot of rest.</p>
<p>An extra intake of Vitamin C won’t do you any harm either, so make sure you have some good juice in the fridge and perhaps some multi-vitamins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
When you start feeling a bit better, there is nothing stopping you trying some gentle postures in the comfort of your own home. There are some awesome yoga classes <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">available online</a> as well. See how it feels, but be truthful with yourself at the same time. Just because you are rushing to get back to the mat, put yourself first. An advanced practice is about self- awareness and honesty. For me, a good rule of thumb is that the postures should feel good – nothing more complicated than that. If you are wishing time away and just doing it for the sake of doing it because you would feel guilty otherwise then you are wasting your time on the mat and you need to take it down a notch.</p>
<p>Relish in the experience of winding down and give yourself some self-love. Yoga isn’t going anywhere &#8211; so don’t rush the recovery process and in no time at all you will be fighting fit.</p>
<p>In the meantime – Get well soon yogi!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>There are conflicting theories as to when it is exactly, <a href="https://entregurus.com/quitters-day/">some suggest</a> it’s the second Friday in January which would have been last Friday on the 10th, and <a href="http://www.stickybottle.com/coaching/strava-reveals-quitters-day-date-most-new-years-resolutions-abandoned/">others suggest</a> it is actually this coming Sunday (the 19th). Whether you believe in Quitter’s Day or not, there is often a slump around this time and a feeling of dejection that the resolutions we made on January 1st are either impossible to achieve or just haven’t made the significant impact we thought they would.<br />
Making a change can be difficult. In fact in can take over 2 months to make a new habit stick so it isn’t surprising that over 80% of us give up on our resolutions early.<br />
It’s very easy to give up, even in our yoga asana class, when we are taught a particularly challenging pose, the body wants to take the path of least resistance which can often lead to dumping weight in postures potentially causing injury, or we can spend hours going to classes but due to apathy and incorrect engagement we do not receive the full benefit of the class.<br />
The same theory can be applied to giving up on our New Year’s Resolutions. By taking the ‘easy way out’ we miss an opportunity for significant self-improvement which makes us feel like failures and well, quite crappy about ourselves.<br />
I’m something of an expert at failing New Year’s Resolutions. That was until a couple of years ago until quite frankly I decided to stick two fingers up to the whole concept. No, not the resolution making but the whole not ‘giving two flying f****’ if I don’t keep them.<br />
Why oh why are we so hard on ourselves if we don’t meet the unrealistic expectations we put on ourselves? In my opinion it’s a complete waste of time and energy.</p>
<p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quitters-day1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quitters-day1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quitters-day1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quitters-day1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Instead, I approach resolutions another way, where I word my affirmations a little differently, and I don’t beat myself up if I slip up now and again. Now I’m not saying my approach is the right way but it is the method that worked for me and has allowed me to carry through with the self-improvement goals I set myself on January 1st.<br />
Firstly I don’t believe in giving anything up when it comes to New Year’s resolutions. Unless you are a smoker, have a poor diet or anything else that could be detrimental to your health then it might want to be an approach you want to consider. Now this is controversial, especially because of things like Dry January and Veganuary (which btw I think are fantastic in terms of raising awareness and money for charity). I just know that by giving up something I take such pleasure from just doesn’t work for me and when I am eventually ‘allowed’ I double down and pay for it the next day with either a hangover or bloated belly. Then I’m just miserable. This for me is not the intention of a New Year’s Resolution. However, this might be a challenge you want to take on and genuinely I applaud those that can and do. You do you.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-672 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/weight-of-the-world-288x300.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/weight-of-the-world-288x300.jpg 288w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/weight-of-the-world-1152x1200.jpg 1152w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/weight-of-the-world-1474x1536.jpg 1474w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/weight-of-the-world-800x833.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/weight-of-the-world.jpg 1696w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></p>
<p>Being too ambitious with your resolutions can also be your downfall. It’s like you are literally setting yourself up to fail before you have even started. Putting unrealistic goals on our to-do lists just adds unnecessary pressure we don’t need. Life can be challenging enough without us adding to it. Being realistic and setting yourself achievable goals are way more likely to lead to success. Maybe you want to give up chocolate and candy because you eat too much of it. Well that’s great but if you love these things going from one extreme to another will just make you feel terrible. Maybe you restrict sugary goodies to the weekend only or treat yourself to your favourite candy bar if you make it a certain number of days without. For me, this makes the determination to succeed so much easier. The carrot and stick method just works.</p>

Social media adverts promising that you will lose 5 stone in 6 weeks or achieving a one arm handstand in one week or less, may be possible for the very few but for most of us we need a little longer. We live in a world where we want everything immediately and get peed off that our resolutions aren’t as easy as the ‘Buy Now’ button. This need for instant gratification can often mean you miss out on the most important part &#8211; the journey of your progress, which can be even more rewarding than the goal itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-681 alignright" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/journey-not-destination-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/journey-not-destination-300x210.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/journey-not-destination-1200x841.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/journey-not-destination-1536x1076.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/journey-not-destination-2048x1435.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/journey-not-destination-800x561.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Change takes time. Be patient and be sure to celebrate the small successes you make along the way because honestly it’s the best feeling. I apply this mindset to my yoga practice….if I set myself an asana goal I don’t attach a timescale to it at all&#8230;I have confidence in myself that one day it will happen but to enjoy how my skills and body awareness develop. It takes work and practise to achieve something worthwhile and you have to savour that process in order to really value the results. As Gandhi said; ‘You must be the change you want to see in the world’.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are a few suggestions that might see you through Quitter’s Day:</p>
<p>1. Ask yourself why you plan on quitting<br />
Does your resolution seem like a never-ending mountain to climb? Is there any way you can make it more achievable? Perhaps the promise to yourself to do an hour yoga class every day is just too much. Try starting small and then as you start to enjoy it more and get into the habit, then you can build on how regularly you show up on the mat.<br />
2. Be specific<br />
For example, I will be healthier in 2020. Well, how? This is not specific enough. Start simple. Perhaps initially your goal will be hitting your 5 fruit and vegetables a day. Then when that becomes second nature you can then increase it. Everything is a building block.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-688" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quittersday2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quittersday2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quittersday2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-quittersday2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
3. Reward yourself<br />
Take smoking for example. Use the money that you would save on cigarettes and use it to reward yourself. If you are someone who smokes on average 5 cigarettes a day, and the average pack of 20 is around £10, you can save over £900 a year! Now that pays for a hell of a decent Christmas, or even contribute to an amazing holiday somewhere – your dream to travel to (insert exotic place here) just got a little easier.<br />
4. Have incentives<br />
This is especially important if you have ‘given up’ something for New year. The plight of raising awareness for charity can add that extra motivation you need to stick to your goals.<br />
5. Find a friend who might have a similar resolution<br />
Support is everything. It’s not surprising that resolutions are far easier to achieve when you work together. It just lightens the load a little bit. If getting fit and joining a gym is on your To Do list, see if one of your friends is thinking of doing the same. Quite often, gyms and health clubs offer further discounts this time of year especially if you bring a friend with you. Also, working out together is WAY more fun.<br />
6. Consider investing in your resolution.<br />
Now this doesn’t have to cost a fortune, but for me this works really well. Depending on your goals, getting the right equipment or some new kit can really help incentivise the next steps.<br />
We just had Christmas. Perhaps you got some vouchers you can spend in the sales or maybe Santa Claus was really good to you and you got a FitBit or Apple Watch which in my experience really kick your butt to be more active than perhaps you normally would be.</p>
<p>7. Setbacks happen<br />
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-692" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/street-sign-141396_1920-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/street-sign-141396_1920-300x227.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/street-sign-141396_1920-1200x907.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/street-sign-141396_1920-1536x1161.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/street-sign-141396_1920-800x605.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/street-sign-141396_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />So don’t beat yourself up about it. I try and avoid Fast Food where I can. However, now and again I just CRAVE a burger. This doesn&#8217;t happen often but when it does, it’s heaven. It can be really easy to come down on yourself hard if you had that extra helping of cake or G&amp;T that you really had every intention of avoiding. But so what? There is nothing stopping you starting again tomorrow and are you less of a person because you had a little something of what you fancied? No you are not. You are not a failure. You are human. Enjoy that G&amp;T and try again the next day. The fact that you are cutting down is in itself a really awesome achievement.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-691 alignright" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-179088284-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />8. Slow and Steady wins the race<br />
It takes time for self-improvement to take effect. Just because things don’t happen immediately doesn’t mean you should stop. In fact the longer something takes the more rewarding it is when you achieve what you set out to.</p>
<p>Small changes can make a big difference and for me personally, I’m more likely to keep my resolution if I enjoy the process – remember it’s the journey NOT the destination.</p>
<p>Finally, if starting a yoga class was on your To Do list for 2020 and you haven’t yet got around to it, start with some <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">online classes</a> at home. Many people are anxious about starting a class, believing that they are unfit and not flexible enough (but this is why you should start!). This in itself is another blog post but do some research. Maybe you find a class you like the sound of but aren’t quite sure. Find out who is teaching the class and reach out. I haven’t met a yoga teacher yet who isn’t happy to answer any questions and if it means that you have the information you need to make it to class then that’s brilliant.</p>
<p>But if you have quit by now, don’t worry about it. It’s JUST a New Year’s resolution and they don’t define whether or not you are a good person. You are still amazing – just the way you are (thank you Bruno).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GO YOU! You’ve finally found a yoga class that you love and a teacher you connect with and have gotten into a routine of getting that cute butt on your mat as often as possible.<br />
And then what? Your yoga teacher only goes and buggers off on holiday/yoga retreat/teacher training/insert other here.<br />
How bloody annoying! Now what are you supposed to do? Sit on the sofa, twiddle one’s thumbs and maybe see what’s new on Netflix. Well here’s another idea… Roll out that mat and develop a wonderful self-practice of your own! Not only will you discover a new level of self-discipline but you will also find self-motivation in your home environment which can be challenging at first, but oh so rewarding if you keep at it.</p>
<p>I feel obliged to write this blog post as I myself am one of those yoga teachers. I’m often away from my students as I have another full time job (like most instructors), that often means I have to travel abroad. I am very fortunate though. The venues I teach at are always incredibly supportive, and the teachers that cover my classes are seriously brilliant, but I’m very aware that for some students they stay at home (not practising) keeping a close eye on my social media to check when I’m back in the country ready to teach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Let’s not forget bank holidays and the Christmas break – it’s absolutely glorious to munch on Lebkuchen and wash it down with a mulled wine while watching Harry Potter, but neglecting a consistent practice can leave you stiff, unbalanced, and well, not quite right.</p>
<p>Your practice doesn’t have to stop because your teacher is away or poorly or if it’s Christmas or summer vacation. First of all, classes are usually covered rather than cancelled (unless it’s last minute or a holiday) and it gives you a beautiful opportunity to experience wisdom from another teacher. I personally love variety. I know what I like and what I don’t but I also love the chance to see how a different teacher operates and sequences a class.</p>
<p>BUT many of us are set in our ways and like our routine – especially us Brits. Therefore a missed class can have more of an impact than just a minor inconvenience. We can feel more stressed and bad tempered without our regular yoga fix.<br />
In my own practice, I usually carve out 2 hours a day for asana and meditation, but when I travel for work this is often impossible. Depending on where I am going and what I am doing, I’m lucky to squeeze in a weekly class which of course massively disrupts my chi.</p>
<p>In my opinion, developing your own practice is essential if you attend classes regularly. Most yogis will practise yoga in some form every day. You only have to look to hard core Ashtangis who are so disciplined they practise 6 days a week.<br />
For the average person who just wants to use yoga for an escape once a week this can be an absurd ask. I often give my students homework but know that less than 10% will actually practice at home.<br />
So what do we do about it?<br />
First of all, figure out realistically how much time you can dedicate to your own practice. Maybe it&#8217;s small pockets of time here and there, or maybe when you really think about it, there is a nice gap one day of the week where you can shut the door and devote that time completely to yourself for some yoga.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-630" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <br />
Work and family life can make this really challenging, but be honest with yourself and work out how much time you can carve out for you. Maybe it means waking up a little earlier to squeeze in a short practice, or hitting the hay a bit later if you need something more restorative.<br />
If you need a little pick me up, even a few rounds of Sun Salutations can energise the body enough for the day ahead, so don’t be so hard on yourself if your free time for a yoga practice isn’t as much as you would like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-642 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Once you have planned in some time for a practice, think about what you would like to work on. Maybe you use the time to work on some skills including more advanced asanas you want to eventually achieve. I personally like to spend more time in my own practice focusing on things that I find more challenging and after a good flow working on more advanced asana allows me to monitor my own progress in strength and flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-645" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you need something more structured you can always look at the plethora of classes available online.<br />
Now your thoughts might instantly be directed to YouTube but I would err on the side of caution here. While there are some amazing instructors on YouTube offering some awesome classes, there is also A LOT of rubbish out there. Quite often you have to trawl through a lot of irrelevant and disappointing classes to find the golden nuggets. I have spent hours finding some good classes on YouTube but to be honest, I only really use it for help with something specific and usually that’s a 5-10 minute tutorial that I use in addition not instead of my practice.<br />
The attraction of YouTube is that it’s free. However, it drives me insane when the adverts pop up and like I said, for me finding a class I love is often like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>What is WAY more effective for me personally is on-demand yoga classes that are taught by my favourite teachers. Yoga teachers whose style I like and who are going to make me feel amazing afterwards. I apply the same attitude as I would when picking a regular yoga class – the teacher matters.<br />
Therefore, if your regular teacher is away and unable to teach your regular class, why not see if they offer a class online? On-demand classes are usually the fraction of the cost of a regular yoga class and you can have them on your computer or smartphone whenever you want them.<br />
For my own personal practice this is the way forward for me. I live in a remote part of the country where advanced classes are quite rare and often what I am personally looking for isn’t available and if it is, it’s at a time when I’m unable to make the class or workshop.<br />
Online classes are also perfect if you are busy and work full time. Fitting in a class at home when it suits you is way more time efficient than hop footing it to class when you factor in how long it takes to get to and from the studio. For example, if I’m teaching a single one hour class it can easily take me two hours minimum and that’s not factoring in the time I like to allow myself before class to greet my students and the time after class to answer any questions. It really doesn’t take a mathematician to work out the time benefits of a home practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
This is one of the main reasons I created my <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. As a teacher I want to reach out to as many people as possible sharing the benefits of my style of teaching as well as offer an alternative to those who, for whatever reason, cannot make it to class. As a student who loves a regular home practice, I wanted to produce classes online that I would want to do, that had enough varied content and useful information to encourage stay-at-home yogis to develop a regular practice wherever they may be.</p>
<p>These awesome online courses when taken together with your regular classes at the studio or the gym result in a beautiful well-rounded practice that will reap benefits of a solid, safe and strong practice which will help you to progress not only physically but mentally as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-647 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-300x193.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-1200x772.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-800x515.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol.jpg 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Another fantastic way to get your yoga fix or even in addition to your regular routine is to find a good yoga podcast. <br />
There are so many incredible teachers who host podcasts full of help and advice on how to deepen your practice, yoga philosophy and even help on how to develop your own practice. When I don&#8217;t have some sci-fi fantasy novel playing on my audible app, I&#8217;m usually listening to a decent yoga podcast. Again, like YouTube some channels I connect with and some I really don&#8217;t, but the beauty of this is that you can expand your knowledge and understanding during your commute or doing daily tasks.</p>
<p>So rather than feel put out if your regular class gets cancelled, check out other options that might work for you. You may just find some online yoga gold, a new community and some awesome new teachers to practice with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s here!!!!! It&#8217;s International Yoga Day!</p>
<p>For most people its the start of summer being the longest day of the year and all, but for those that regularly roll out their mat it&#8217;s a day the yoga community come together and mark the occasion with special classes and events.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-505" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3499-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />This special day has been recognised since 2015 and was first proposed by India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his UN address in September 2014 and is recognised as a way of promoting peace, harmony and of course health all over the world &#8211; kinda cool eh?</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to spend my morning with a couple of regular clients as well as my Friday class at Anytime Fitness in Dorchester. The sun was shining and we spent our time practising Yin Yoga at the wall stretching the entire body &#8211; a beautiful way to celebrate the International Day of Yoga, but also a fabulous way to end the week and get re-energised for the weekend.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-507" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3505-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />I have then spent the rest of my day luxuriating in my own practice, focusing on opening my shoulders and stretching parts of my body that needed some much-needed TLC. Ending with some Pranayama and you will find me in my best mood&#8230;..ever.</p>
<p>Another wonderful thing about this day is that many awesome yoga brands have discounts. So if you need a new yoga mat or want to update your yogadrobe (so copyrighting that!) then now is the time. Here is my quick rundown of a few of my favourite brands that are currently offering discounts on their sites. But hurry, some of these offers are only valid for this special day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogarebel.com"><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogarebel.com"><strong>Yoga Rebel</strong></a></p>
<p>Save 25% on all your favourite yoga brands as Yoga Rebel are offering this amazing discount on EVERYTHING &#8211; including their outlet. It&#8217;s a really great opportunity to buy from brands like Alo Yoga where you don&#8217;t risk the customs charges and you can save money on higher priced brands. Just use the code &#8216;YOGADAY25&#8217;. Annoyingly, I am likely to spend a lot of money here  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f615.png" alt="😕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sweatybetty.com/shop/reversible-high-waisted-7-8-yoga-leggings-SB4560_NightFernPrint.html?cgid=shop&amp;dwvar_SB4560__NightFernPrint_color=nightfernprint&amp;tile=13#prefn1=product-type&amp;prefv1=All+Bottoms&amp;start=13"><strong>Sweaty Betty</strong></a></p>
<p>Sweaty Betty are doing something very different here. You can save 50% for one day only on one of their favourite items but you have to find &#8216;Betty&#8217;&#8230;. I have done the hard work for you and found the item, just click the link above and it will take you to the half priced leggings. But hurry, at that discount the sizes will sell out fast! <strong> </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freespirit.co"><strong>Free Spirit</strong></a></p>
<p>For one day only Free Spirit are offering 20% off using discount code &#8216;YOGADAY20&#8217;. </p>
<p>Free Spirit never do sales, aside from Earth Day and Yoga Day and this is something I really respect in the brand. What&#8217;s wonderful about this company is their ethos &#8211; they are passionate about our planet and use sustainable materials in their clothing. Check out their ECO range online &#8211; leggings made from plastic bottles! There is no downside here! Look fabulous in your new gear and help save our planet &#8211; Mr Attenborough would be proud!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogamatters.com"><strong>Yogamatters</strong></a></p>
<p>This fabulous online yoga retailer sells absolutely everything you need to get started in your yoga practice. From mats, towels, and bags through to props, clothing and even essential oils and tea! A great place for all your essentials and even a little extra. Today, Yogamatters are offering 20% off all Manduka and Yogamatters products. No code needed, just visit the site above and click on the link and it will take your right to the products on sale!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.liforme.com"><strong>Liforme</strong></a></p>
<p>These mats are like no other. These mats I use for my own personal practice. I love my Manduka mats as their durability is just wonderful, but for anyone working on Alignment or needing a more grippy mat for a practice that consists of a lot of arm balancing and inversions, then this is the mat for you. Personally, given the price I wouldn&#8217;t invest in these mats unless you are serious about your practice or certainly practicing regularly. What sets these mats apart for me is first and foremost the grip, but also these mats are PVC-free and biodegradable. YAY! Today save 10% on Liforme mats using code &#8216;YOGADAY2019&#8217;. What&#8217;s more, Liforme are donating 5% of all sales during the day to charity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oysho.com/gb/oyshosport.html"><strong>Oysho</strong></a></p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a specific discount for Yoga Day but there is a 50% sale on Oysho at the moment. I have to say their leggings are so chic and I love the printed graphics on their sportswear as well. One thing I will say, is in my experience the sizes are a tad &#8216;snug&#8217;. So you may want to consider going up a size or buying two sizes to see what works. </p>
<p><a href="https://thesportsedit.com/pages/sale"><strong>The Sports Edit</strong></a></p>
<p>Finally, not specific to Yoga Day, but The Sports Edit currently have an amazing sale on they activewear. You can save on brands like Adidas, Under Armour and Spiritual Gangster. I have my eye on a few items in this sale&#8230;.it&#8217;s going to be an expensive month&#8230;sigh</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/"><strong>sida yoga</strong></a></p>
<p>As I am plugging all these other brands, I may as well mention myself as well! Today I launched my online shop in honour of International Yoga Day. As I start to grow my product range, we start off with a gorgeous little piece of handmade artwork for your yoga room or studio. Hand-stitched in an interchangeable frame this would make a lovely gift for someone or even yourself  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do today, I hope International Yoga Day is magic and glorious!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My palms are sweaty, my heart is in my throat, my brain isn&#8217;t working and I feel quite sick.<br />
I&#8217;m surrounded by the sound of hundreds of pens scribbling furiously, while I stare blankly at the paper in front of me that only has my name and the date, and I am not entirely sure I&#8217;ve written that correctly.</p>
<p>Question 1 is an essay question and I&#8217;m pretty sure of the subject but can&#8217;t recall any facts to back up my answer despite cramming the night before on this very topic&#8230;yep, I think I am about to throw up.</p>
<p>&#8216;Vic?&#8230;Vic? I made you a cup of tea&#8217;.<br />
THANK GOODNESS for that. It&#8217;s the boyfriend waking me up. It was just a dream &#8211; a nightmare actually, but I remember all too well that dreaded exam time at school and university.</p>
<p>I was a good student and I worked pretty hard but the harsh reality was that my memory was pants. My peers seemed naturally gifted and I felt I was putting in two hours of study for every hour everyone else put in and it just sucked. At the time, it felt like the whole world was on my shoulders and my entire future rested on whether or not I could remember the right law case or correct Trigonometry formula. Don&#8217;t even get me started on essays &#8211; I was rubbish at writing essays.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />I don&#8217;t think I will ever forget the stress surrounding exams and tests &#8211; even non-academic ones. The evening before my driving test I suddenly had a panic attack forgetting what lane I needed to be in for going straight on a roundabout and before I knew it I had smoked an entire packet of cigarettes in an attempt to calm down (I hadn&#8217;t smoked for years). Needless to say it did not help my stress levels and in fact helped me develop a hoarse cough that took a month to shift.</p>
<p>Oh how I wish I had discovered yoga back then. I can&#8217;t help but feel that had I taken that time out for myself to calm down and relax I would have found exam time so much easier.<br />
The pressure I put on myself to do well and a need to make sure that I didn&#8217;t disappoint anyone around me just brought on a level of anxiety that was just off the scale.<br />
If I was ever advised to take time off I would always be afraid that it meant time away from the books which was vital time wasted where I could be learning another topic.</p>
<p>Of course, now I am older and wiser I realise I went about it all wrong. Breaks are important and while I did pretty well at school and university I can&#8217;t help but feeling that had I taken more time to look after myself I would have done better.<br />
Just as I write this, I am having a small flashback to my uni days in the weeks leading up to my dissertation deadline. I was living in the computer lab wrapped in a sleeping back surviving off salt and vinegar Pringles and bacon sandwiches &#8211; hardly brain food. Such an idiot.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-446" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-1200x728.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-800x485.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1.jpg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Just like a good Savasana at the end of class gives the body a chance to recover and observe all the sensations of the class, we need to apply this STOP and EVALUATE method to life, particularly when faced with stressful situations like exam time.</p>
<p>It is so important to develop good habits and look after your mind and body &#8211; even more so when you are studying. It will feel like time is short and you just don&#8217;t have time, but time out doing something worthwhile (like yoga) will mean when you return to study you will feel more energised and way less stressed.</p>
<p>This is why I have developed a brand new yoga course designed at combatting stress and increasing focus and attention. As well as making sure you get enough sleep and eat the right foods, trying something like this yoga will help to calm the mind and help the body relax and recharge for the next time you hit the books.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-455" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />If you are interested in finding out more about our 1-2-1 sessions or would like to bring these wonderful classes to your school or college, contact us via the website or comment below and we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>Yoga cannot guarantee your A* or First, but it can help create the mind space for you to find an easier path to achieve better results with much less stress. What have you got to lose?</p>
<p>Namaste</p>
