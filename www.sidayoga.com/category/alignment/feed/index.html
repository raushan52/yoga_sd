								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg" alt="green meadow, inner peace" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1071495136-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As a yoga teacher I hear and see this all the time; &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing that&#8217; or &#8216;My legs/torso/arms/(insert other here) are too short/long&#8217;. Or, I get the quiet ones who just tend to look at me in horror waiting for the challenge to be over and we move on to something more accessible.</p>
<p>Unless you have an injury or a similar reason for not being able to do the posture or challenge, then I always expect my students to at least give it a go. &#8216;Just try&#8217; I say.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-735 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-848216056-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Sometimes students fall or lose balance and I smile and say &#8216;That&#8217;s awesome! That shows me you went for it&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t try, you will be forever stuck where you are, unable to progress and running away from challenges rather than facing them. I try to encourage my students to take what they learn on the mat, away with them off the mat. If what you learnt from your class that day was to stick your head in the stand and shy away from a posture then that&#8217;s not really what I want you to take away from my class. I want you to feel empowered, strong and wanting to do more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-745 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png 290w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1158x1200.png 1158w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-800x829.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920.png 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>I also HATE the word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; in an asana practice. Instead, I explain to my class&#8230;it&#8217;s just &#8216;not yet&#8217;. This is the mantra I try to repeat as often as possible to those students who just feel stuck and run away. I find this re-phrasing tends to resonate with people more than me putting my strict teacher face on. I like to give an example of something that they can do today that they couldn&#8217;t do before. The simplest example I can think of is walking. We cannot walk from birth, this is something we learn to do. It may take us 9 months to a year (or even longer) of falling on our backsides before we take our first steps, but it happens with time and patience, and it&#8217;s really as simple as that.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to asanas you currently find impossible to achieve. We live in a world where many of us want instant gratification and quite often, we don&#8217;t want to put in the hard work required to nail the posture. What&#8217;s even worse is when it can take years to make even the smallest shift to progress.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, some students can take the &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach. &#8216;I can&#8217;t get there right now so why bother?&#8217; </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-753 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
It can feel disheartening when you can&#8217;t yet do something. Especially when the shape looks simple enough. It&#8217;s very easy to take the &#8216;can&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do&#8217; route, when I can guarantee there is a possible path to the posture that will work for you right now. Take the modifications and make use of props and yoga toys to make yourself feel supported in the posture. Find <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">tutorials online</a> to help give you ideas on how you can make a posture more accessible. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-749 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1171447238-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Something that one of my favourite yogis <a href="https://www.elvisgarciayoga.com">Elvis Garcia</a> mentioned in one of his online classes I took years ago, still sticks with me today; &#8216;Any part of the pose is still the pose&#8217;. I absolutely LOVE this and it&#8217;s so so true. Let&#8217;s take the example of Bakasana (Crow pose). Even working on lifting your hips higher from Malasana pose while you plant the hands is still <em>part</em> of the pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feet stay on the ground or not. We are training our bodies into the shape of the posture and working our muscle memory so we get one step closer to our goal. You can still engage the bandhas and find the correct protraction of the shoulders even with the feet firmly planted on the ground. Sitting on your butt and willing the moment to pass, <i>isn&#8217;t </i>part of the pose and you will never get there in a month of Sundays. If something is holding you back figure out what that is and work with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s a fear of falling in which case <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sidayoga/videos/1652540961451389/">pad the space around you</a> with as many pillows you can find, and then just fall. A soft landing with arm balances can really help take the fear out of the attempt, which might be the very thing holding you back.</p>
<p>I am a curvy girl with boobs and I&#8217;ve had teachers tell me some postures will never be in my repertoire. Well poo to that! Certain postures might not come as easy to me as others, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up. I&#8217;m going to work with the goods God gave me and make it work, and you know what &#8211; this hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>Get out of your head. Just because thousands of people on Instagram can do that handstand you can&#8217;t quite nail yet, don&#8217;t be under any illusion. They probably had to work their a$$es off to get there. Strength drills, flexibility exercises, shoulder opening and dedication&#8230;every day. That famous yoga <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yogaeverydamnday/?hl=en">hashtag</a> exists for a reason!</p>
<p>And guys and gals please&#8230; there is NO SUCH THING AS CAN&#8217;T &#8211; just NOT YET!</p>
<p>Start thinking like Frodo and get your Fellowship together and start that long journey. Just like the Fellowship, you will have some serious hurdles to climb, and perhaps you will often feel like giving up, but commit yourself to the process. You won&#8217;t save Middle Earth, but I can guarantee you will feel incredible when you eventually realise the goals that you feel are impossible today. In fact, the longer the journey, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when you finally get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Here is my advice on how to <del>save Middle Earth</del> get one step closer to your asana goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAKE THE MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teacher offers a variation to a challenging pose, try it. There is no requirement to shoot and score the pose the first try. Feel it out. Maybe grab your blocks and a strap and see how the props can help with the pose. Try not to rely on them too much, particularly in the example of using the wall for inversions &#8211; it&#8217;s very easy to get to a place where your best friend and crutch turns into something you rely on too much and again you can become stuck, or get used to incorrect alignment which can cause injury.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF THE POSE</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-756 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/handstand-preop-with-block-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Is the posture one that opens up the shoulders? Or perhaps it&#8217;s completely focused on the core. In which case, take some time to practice drills that will build strength or open up the body in those areas. If you are even attempting arm balancing you should be warming up your wrists before you bear weight on your hands. Look at what the pose is asking from you and then do some extra homework to make the goal pose that little bit more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yoga-pose-plank-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Progress may happen quickly or slowly but however long it takes, take the time to check in and look at how far you have come. Maybe you are managing a kick up handstand to the wall now, after starting at zero. Perhaps holding plank pose for those extra 10 seconds is alot more doable. This is all progress and looking at how far you have come gives you a good indication of how far you have to go and makes the end goal way more realistic. </p>
<ul>
<li>CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanumanasana (full splits) for example takes time. You need open hip flexors and hamstrings and quite often these areas are a tight spot for many people, especially if you are an athlete. As the body gradually opens the more you practice, take a moment to celebrate every time you get closer and closer to the full posture. Celebrate and take joy in every miracle millimetre. It&#8217;s a good reminder that it&#8217;s the journey that matters not the destination.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a ballet dancer, I always thought when it came to alignment in yoga I would nail it, no question. I&#8217;d spent years practicing my &#8216;good toes, naughty toes&#8217; and perfecting my posture in class so figured I had it down. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I took my first alignment class in Shanghai did I realise that it was so much more than having decent posture and looking pretty. I felt I was taking yoga to another level once I started to understand my body a bit more and could then attempt postures and &#8216;feel&#8217; the pose rather than just &#8216;doing&#8217; the pose. Something I wish I had understood a little better when practising ballet &#8211; my grand jete certainly would have had more oomph that&#8217;s for sure!</p>
<p>Alignment was also far more challenging than I expected it to be. Classes involved holding poses for a longer period of time in order to feel and connect to the pose on a deeper level. We would use blocks, yoga straps and the wall to help align our bodies, particularly for some of the standing postures and it was eye-opening to discover that up until that point I hadn&#8217;t been opening my body as much as I could or engaging my muscles properly.</p>
<p>So what is alignment? Alignment alone is a collection of instructions for every pose where the body is positioned in a certain way that allows you to then experience the full benefit of the pose while avoiding injury, promoting balance and improving posture and strength. Different yoga styles have their own views on alignment so it can be a rather confusing topic. Every person&#8217;s body is different and therefore so is each person&#8217;s alignment. What can appear as a prescribed list of requirements for a pose will not work for everyone. Therefore, the aim is to guide students into a pose that they can perform to the best of their ability and ultimately reach a solid foundation as well as a deeper understanding of how their body works and whether or not the next stage of a pose is accessible. It&#8217;s all about the journey, not the destination.</p>
<p>For me, this is rather humbling and took me a while to accept. Flicking through thousands of pictures on Instagram getting frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t balance on one hand and press to handstand overnight. As a dancer I was always blessed with flexibility and naturally open hips seem to run in my family, but as any normal person I was annoyed that what I had in flexibility I lacked in core strength. As I started to focus more on alignment and as I discovered during my teacher training through the guidance of two wonderful teachers, I discovered that what was most important in my practice was the actual process. As long as I was paying attention to instructions and focusing on a few core concepts and the purpose of each asana, progression to the next stage was something I could decide for myself and that was a really cool experience for me. A lot like having the stabilisers on your bike taken off for the first time and then being able to go anywhere. Liberating!</p>
<p>When we talk about anatomy and yoga it all seems so obvious. Rather than be put off by this idea of perfection we can relax in the knowledge that what is perfect for one person may not be the same for another. By focusing on developing awareness, alignment becomes something that is far easier to understand and accomplish. </p>
<p>During my training, I was introduced to &#8216;Proprioception&#8217;. This is the body&#8217;s ability to know it&#8217;s position without actually looking. It is the perception of yourself in space and therefore a cognitive process. The proprioceptors in our muscles are sensitive to stretching and help us in yoga to develop our body awareness.  Proprioception can be developed with practice. By taking the time to observe your position when performing a pose and using the breath to synchronise movement, our proprioceptive sensors are activated and this allows the body to balance itself in its environment. These simple techniques allow us to strengthen our body&#8217;s response system and results in better placement, posture and alignment.</p>
<p>Developing your proprioception can sometimes be super hard. I picked up a handy tip during my training which I have since found invaluable for helping my alignment and how my body feels in a particular position. Grab a Sharpie and using a decent ruler, draw a line down the centre of your mat. I know, I know, I too was initially horrified at the idea of defacing my otherwise sparkly Lululemon mat but trust me it will help. That simple line will help you when lining up your heels in standing poses, squaring your hips and placing your hands for Plank or Downward dog and so much more. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-119 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment.jpg" alt="sida yoga professional tools mark mat how to lines block markings correct alignment" width="1200" height="310" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment-800x207.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment-300x78.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Shifting focus on how a pose feels rather than how it looks is the aim of the game. I love using props in my practice as I find they help to open up the body more and support safe alignment. I know many students who get put off using props feeling that they are only for beginners, but this is simply not true. Yoga blocks and straps help to create length and space in the body and allow us to access the correct muscles when verbal guides are not enough.</p>
<p>When I first started my yoga journey, phrases like &#8216;lift your knee caps&#8217;, &#8216;tuck your tailbone&#8217; and &#8216;engage your core&#8217; left me bewildered. I&#8217;m not really one of those people who is too proud to ask a question when I am stuck even if there is a risk I might look a bit stupid, so one day I just asked. I was lucky to have such a wonderful down-to-earth teacher who reassured me I wasn&#8217;t alone in my seemingly simple questions. </p>
<p>I was told to sit in Dandasana with my feet against the wall. I was then told to contract my quadriceps by drawing my thigh muscles up as if I was standing strong in Tadasana. From this simple exercise I could see my knee caps lift and realised it was all about my thigh muscles and I was getting all caught up in what my knees were doing and it was all about engaging my thighs. This is so important in yoga as it helps to protect the knee from hyperextension. Keeping this in mind, standing poses immediately become stronger and more solid and of course safer. </p>
<p>&#8216;Tucking the tailbone&#8217; can be quite misleading. Like our bodies, the position of the pelvis is also different from person to person. Whether the pelvis tilt is anterior, posterior or neutral, the cue to tuck the tailbone just won&#8217;t work for everyone. Instead, by drawing the hips towards one another, the belly in and up and the tailbone down the leg muscles strengthen and the lower back is protected. The pelvis feels balanced and the core is strengthened. </p>
<p>The core and understanding all the muscles attached to it requires a post in its own right, but for now I will attempt to put it in a way that is a little less puzzling. When we engage our core we want to support and stabilise the spine. When done correctly it feels like having something tight like a corset or a belt wrapped around your waist. Pull the muscle around your waist towards the midline to try and get that feeling. Lastly, you want to tighten the pelvic floor muscles up towards your navel. Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from going to the toilet. All our movements are initiated from an engaged core. It can be a weird feeling so a handy tip would be to try this when not exercising. While waiting for the kettle to boil or brushing your teeth, get your body used to this hugged in feeling and then when you get on the mat engaging your core will feel more natural.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other alignment cues you can incorporate into your practice, and while I don&#8217;t expect anyone to remember all of them having some idea of just a few of the principles will make your practice easier and far more effective. Your foundation will be stronger, you will become aligned with gravity, have more energy and use less effort to do poses that currently seem out of reach. </p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-124" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg" alt="monk feet yoga alignment rose petal" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />During a class always think about your feet. We always hear teachers telling us to ground our feet but what that actually means is distribute your weight evenly into all four corners of the feet which are your inner and outer heel, your big toe mound and your pinky toe mound. To get a good feel for what we are aiming for here, stand in Tadasana. Lift all your toes, and then the area on the ball of your foot underneath the big toe feel that area press downwards and back towards your inner heel. Then do the same with the area underneath your pinky toes, pushing downwards and back towards your outer heels. Then allow the rest of the toes to come down to the floor. The point of this is to feel the arches lift and activate the legs. You will notice how much more grounded and stable you are. If you are not grounded, it is very hard to maintain a solid and spacious pose.</p>
<p>The same also applies when placing our hands. Fingers should be spread wide pointing forwards and the pads underneath our knuckles should press firmly into the mat as well as your fingertips. Do not collapse into the heels of your hands as this will put unnecessary strain on your wrists. You want to imagine you are creating a suction pad with your hands which will then help to support the weight you can put on your hands particularly in arm balancing poses.</p>
<p>We are always looking for space in our asanas. We never want to feel bunched up or like areas of our body are collapsing into other parts of our body. We want to be always lengthening from our spine (unless specifically instructed to do otherwise), softening our shoulders to avoid tension and keeping our necks long. As a teacher, the amount of times I see students collapsing in poses like Trikonasana just because they want to touch the floor, forgetting the point of the asana. Use your blocks, that&#8217;s what they are there for to help you find space in a pose.</p>
<p>Lastly, but by no means least focus on the breath. The breath is energetically nourishing the anatomical posture and therefore should be our primary focus. Aligning our breath with our movement allows us to move a little easier through the poses. Our minds become quiet which means our focus increases.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-123" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg" alt="sidayoga yoga buddha body mind spirit" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-800x450.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When practising yoga, all the asanas should work for you in a good way and not cause any pain or discomfort. Make sure to inform your teacher of any injuries and remember a class is not a posture race. Use the verbal cues from your teacher as a guide to reach a deeper connection with a pose and don&#8217;t be afraid to use any props that are available to you. As soon as one stage of a pose becomes easy, understand when your body is ready to move on or go deeper, but take your time. Alignment may appear to be physically focused but the mind&#8217;s role is just as important. Alignment of the body, mind and spirit will mean your practice will become stronger, more steady and ultimately more relaxed. </p>
