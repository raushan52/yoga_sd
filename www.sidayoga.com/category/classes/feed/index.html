<p>How do you develop  a consistent yoga practice at home?</p>
<p>We are certainly living in extraordinary times right now. Every single one of us has had to adapt to a new temporary way of life as we try and stay safe during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Many of my students work for the NHS. When I catch myself in a grump, frustrated that I can’t see friends for a cheeky vino or attend a family BBQ, I think of them. Staying home really is a small ask in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my life is pretty well-equipped to deal with self-isolation. I don’t have children so no need to don my teacher’s hat. Working from home for me is normal and my yoga practice is 98% a home practice. I enjoy solitary walks outside and so far I’m enjoying my partner being at home all the time. I do miss my family and friends though. That makes my heart hurt a bit. Thank goodness for Zoom and House Party.</p>
<p>Many have used this time to get those jobs ticked off the ‘to-do’ list, improve their homes, unleash their creativity, learn a musical instrument or even learn a language.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>While I applaud that motivation with as much vivacity as my <a href="https://clapforourcarers.co.uk">8pm applause</a> on Thursdays, I can’t help but feel this is all a bit ‘New Years’ Resolutiony’ for the rest of us.</p>
<p>These are strange times and for many, the days can roll into one, routine can be challenging and #selfisolation goals can make us feel even worse if <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2020/01/to-quit-or-not-to-quit/">we don’t accomplish them</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need some reassurance, and perhaps that reassurance needs to be a little more helpful than ‘you are not alone’. You do not need to conquer the world right now.</p>
<p>Use this time to connect…to yourself.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to start a home yoga practice, or a time you needed it more.</p>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/shop"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>With more online yoga than ever before, you don’t have to look far to find live classes. Every day you can find something from all of your favourite teachers. But even this can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>We have put together a few ways to help you get started with a home practice. Take this opportunity to focus on your well-being, boost your motivation and perhaps find some peace in all this craziness.</p>
<h3><strong>Do Not Disturb</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1043 " src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="279" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg 218w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-873x1200.jpg 873w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-800x1100.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb.jpg 945w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" />Make sure that you create a space for your practice where you will not be disturbed. Treat this time, similar to if you were about to take a long, relaxing soak in the tub.</p>
<p>Even though you are practising in your own home, you need to imagine you are attending your usual class. I think this is where most people struggle with a home practice.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to check your phone and get distracted because the environment isn’t set up for you to get your zen on. Usually everywhere we look in our homes, there is something (or someone) that requires our attention.</p>
<p>As best you can, try and set up a small space of tranquility. This is you time, and you want to be able to create the most authentic yoga space you can.</p>
<h3><strong>Make time</strong></h3>
<p>So many <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/">online schedules</a> are available right now, which makes it alot easier to work into your schedule. Apply the same mindset to <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. Just because it isn&#8217;t live, you still need to consciously set time aside to do it. Pop a slot in the diary and make that extra effort to incorporate the classes into your daily routine.</p>
<p>It is important you approach online classes with the same attitude as an ‘in person’ class. This really works for me and helps keep my motivation.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1047" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1200x803.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-800x535.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you are working from home, it can be all too easy to fall into the same pattern. Working through lunch breaks and pattering away at your keyboard for more hours than you should. You still need to take time out and have the breaks that you would normally when working in an office.</p>
<p>Taking an online class will also help to break up the monotony of the day. At the moment, it can feel like each day rolls into the next. Whether you schedule in a live class or a pre-recorded session, both are fantastic opportunities to create variety to ‘samey’ days.</p>
<p>I like to do my practice a couple of hours after my breakfast, and then after some admin and email checking, I’m ready for something yummy for lunch and then I power through work until dinner. For me, that schedule works really well for my routine and allows me to be motivated throughout the day and be more productive. Make a commitment and then the next time you set a time for your practice it will be even easier to stick to.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove any expectations</strong></h3>
<p>So you didn’t do a full 90 minute class and when you did, your online food delivery arrived and the postman called. The kids need your attention and the office has scheduled a Skype call over lunch. So what? Beating yourself up about it isn’t going to make you feel any better.</p>
<p>Life happens. Distractions happen.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1052 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The intention to show up on your mat and make the time is a massive deal.  Just a few minutes in Child’s Pose (Balasana) or even taking 5 minutes in a seated meditation can be enough to reconnect.</p>
<p>When the day runs away from me and I haven’t done anything, you can usually find me on my mat in a supported Fish pose. I personally hold a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders, so this posture works wonders for me when time is short.</p>
<p>Find a pose that helps you relax and open up the body. There is always tomorrow for a Power Rocket class.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep it simple</strong></h3>
<p>This kind of follows on from the point above.</p>
<p>You don’t need a complicated yoga schedule right now. What would you like to work on to improve your practice?</p>
<p>I have one lovely student who keeps requesting hip openers for virtual classes. Usually, I would be like, sweets come on you gotta mix things up a bit! For now, I refrain from suggesting anything of the sort. That&#8217;s what makes her feel good right now, then who am I to tell her she should be doing backbends. Indulge in something that will help you rock up on your mat &#8211; even if it is hip opener after hip opener. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-938 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg" alt="Pyjama Yoga Online Classes Sida Yoga Evening Relaxation Calm Meditation Namaste StayAtHome" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Perhaps you want to take more time to relax, or maybe you would like to try a new style of yoga.</p>
<p>I’ve recently enjoyed discovering new styles myself thanks to virtual yoga. This is a great time to try something new. However, it is easy to get overwhelmed with choices. Try not to set yourself an impossible to-do list of yoga classes. Hone in on what you want from a practice. For me, I love alignment so Anusara is a good fit. I&#8217;ve always fancied having a go at Rocket yoga, and virtual classes have made these new styles possible to try. </p>
<p>Figure out what you want from your home practice and find the programs to suit your personal goals and requirements. That way, you aren’t just doing a class because you feel you have to. You are literally following the path of self improvement and that will make you feel so much better inside and out.</p>
<h3><strong>Join an online class or find a course</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>Use this opportunity to connect with your favourite teachers. I have been fortunate enough to practise yoga in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, China, USA and more&#8230; I&#8217;ve found wonderful teachers who I always make the effort to see whenever I am in the country. Today I can connect with every single one of them thanks to virtual classes, which is something I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>As I connect more with yogi friends I have met all over the world, I’m finding the virtual support and shares really fantastic.</p>
<p>I’ve actually really enjoyed teaching online and will probably continue some of the classes when the self isolation rules are lifted.</p>
<p>For me it’s been a lovely way to connect with my students and I’ve enjoyed the challenge of finding simpler alignment cues that don’t necessarily need me to be there in person. As a teacher it’s been more physically demanding as well – particularly with the stronger vinyasa classes.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t a substitute for actual interaction with a person. However, the current situation has actually been a really special learning experience. For me, it’s much more efficient to use these times as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than wither and wallow. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>If all else fails, shake your booty</strong></h3>
<figure id="attachment_1059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1059" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1059 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1059" class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<p>So your brand new yoga mat is still in its packaging. Your new #workoutathome yoga pants still have the labels attached. The online yoga course you bought still hasn&#8217;t been used and you are ready to give up.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter. It really doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Put on those fabulous new star print yoga leggings and shake that cute booty while you make a cup of tea. Laugh at yourself.</p>
<p>Ask Alexa to play your favourite track and dance like no one is watching. I promise it will make you feel better.</p>
<p>Yoga isn&#8217;t going anywhere and you don&#8217;t have to conquer the world right now. All you need to do to be a superhero is stay at home. </p>
<p>Peace and love yogis xox</p>
<p> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>

However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1071495136-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As a yoga teacher I hear and see this all the time; &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing that&#8217; or &#8216;My legs/torso/arms/(insert other here) are too short/long&#8217;. Or, I get the quiet ones who just tend to look at me in horror waiting for the challenge to be over and we move on to something more accessible.</p>
<p>Unless you have an injury or a similar reason for not being able to do the posture or challenge, then I always expect my students to at least give it a go. &#8216;Just try&#8217; I say.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-735 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-848216056-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Sometimes students fall or lose balance and I smile and say &#8216;That&#8217;s awesome! That shows me you went for it&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t try, you will be forever stuck where you are, unable to progress and running away from challenges rather than facing them. I try to encourage my students to take what they learn on the mat, away with them off the mat. If what you learnt from your class that day was to stick your head in the stand and shy away from a posture then that&#8217;s not really what I want you to take away from my class. I want you to feel empowered, strong and wanting to do more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-745 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png 290w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1158x1200.png 1158w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-800x829.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920.png 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>I also HATE the word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; in an asana practice. Instead, I explain to my class&#8230;it&#8217;s just &#8216;not yet&#8217;. This is the mantra I try to repeat as often as possible to those students who just feel stuck and run away. I find this re-phrasing tends to resonate with people more than me putting my strict teacher face on. I like to give an example of something that they can do today that they couldn&#8217;t do before. The simplest example I can think of is walking. We cannot walk from birth, this is something we learn to do. It may take us 9 months to a year (or even longer) of falling on our backsides before we take our first steps, but it happens with time and patience, and it&#8217;s really as simple as that.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to asanas you currently find impossible to achieve. We live in a world where many of us want instant gratification and quite often, we don&#8217;t want to put in the hard work required to nail the posture. What&#8217;s even worse is when it can take years to make even the smallest shift to progress.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, some students can take the &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach. &#8216;I can&#8217;t get there right now so why bother?&#8217; </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-753 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
It can feel disheartening when you can&#8217;t yet do something. Especially when the shape looks simple enough. It&#8217;s very easy to take the &#8216;can&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do&#8217; route, when I can guarantee there is a possible path to the posture that will work for you right now. Take the modifications and make use of props and yoga toys to make yourself feel supported in the posture. Find <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">tutorials online</a> to help give you ideas on how you can make a posture more accessible. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-749 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1171447238-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Something that one of my favourite yogis <a href="https://www.elvisgarciayoga.com">Elvis Garcia</a> mentioned in one of his online classes I took years ago, still sticks with me today; &#8216;Any part of the pose is still the pose&#8217;. I absolutely LOVE this and it&#8217;s so so true. Let&#8217;s take the example of Bakasana (Crow pose). Even working on lifting your hips higher from Malasana pose while you plant the hands is still <em>part</em> of the pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feet stay on the ground or not. We are training our bodies into the shape of the posture and working our muscle memory so we get one step closer to our goal. You can still engage the bandhas and find the correct protraction of the shoulders even with the feet firmly planted on the ground. Sitting on your butt and willing the moment to pass, <i>isn&#8217;t </i>part of the pose and you will never get there in a month of Sundays. If something is holding you back figure out what that is and work with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s a fear of falling in which case <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sidayoga/videos/1652540961451389/">pad the space around you</a> with as many pillows you can find, and then just fall. A soft landing with arm balances can really help take the fear out of the attempt, which might be the very thing holding you back.</p>
<p>I am a curvy girl with boobs and I&#8217;ve had teachers tell me some postures will never be in my repertoire. Well poo to that! Certain postures might not come as easy to me as others, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up. I&#8217;m going to work with the goods God gave me and make it work, and you know what &#8211; this hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>Get out of your head. Just because thousands of people on Instagram can do that handstand you can&#8217;t quite nail yet, don&#8217;t be under any illusion. They probably had to work their a$$es off to get there. Strength drills, flexibility exercises, shoulder opening and dedication&#8230;every day. That famous yoga <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yogaeverydamnday/?hl=en">hashtag</a> exists for a reason!</p>
<p>And guys and gals please&#8230; there is NO SUCH THING AS CAN&#8217;T &#8211; just NOT YET!</p>
<p>Start thinking like Frodo and get your Fellowship together and start that long journey. Just like the Fellowship, you will have some serious hurdles to climb, and perhaps you will often feel like giving up, but commit yourself to the process. You won&#8217;t save Middle Earth, but I can guarantee you will feel incredible when you eventually realise the goals that you feel are impossible today. In fact, the longer the journey, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when you finally get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Here is my advice on how to <del>save Middle Earth</del> get one step closer to your asana goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAKE THE MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teacher offers a variation to a challenging pose, try it. There is no requirement to shoot and score the pose the first try. Feel it out. Maybe grab your blocks and a strap and see how the props can help with the pose. Try not to rely on them too much, particularly in the example of using the wall for inversions &#8211; it&#8217;s very easy to get to a place where your best friend and crutch turns into something you rely on too much and again you can become stuck, or get used to incorrect alignment which can cause injury.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF THE POSE</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-756 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/handstand-preop-with-block-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Is the posture one that opens up the shoulders? Or perhaps it&#8217;s completely focused on the core. In which case, take some time to practice drills that will build strength or open up the body in those areas. If you are even attempting arm balancing you should be warming up your wrists before you bear weight on your hands. Look at what the pose is asking from you and then do some extra homework to make the goal pose that little bit more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yoga-pose-plank-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Progress may happen quickly or slowly but however long it takes, take the time to check in and look at how far you have come. Maybe you are managing a kick up handstand to the wall now, after starting at zero. Perhaps holding plank pose for those extra 10 seconds is alot more doable. This is all progress and looking at how far you have come gives you a good indication of how far you have to go and makes the end goal way more realistic. </p>
<ul>
<li>CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanumanasana (full splits) for example takes time. You need open hip flexors and hamstrings and quite often these areas are a tight spot for many people, especially if you are an athlete. As the body gradually opens the more you practice, take a moment to celebrate every time you get closer and closer to the full posture. Celebrate and take joy in every miracle millimetre. It&#8217;s a good reminder that it&#8217;s the journey that matters not the destination.</p>

<p>That would be a hard…no. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, I was bed-ridden with the flu. You know you have the flu if you spot a £50 note on the floor and simply don’t have the capacity to even think about picking it up. I spent most of my time in my pyjamas in bed feeling very sorry for myself. My body ached, my throat was coarse and my ears were beyond painful.</p>
<p>Two days into flu-gate and I really didn’t feel like I was getting any better despite the R&amp;R and polishing off the best part of a bottle of Benylin (or maybe it was 3 bottles!).</p>
<p>I was also getting increasingly frustrated that I couldn’t do my daily practice, but in truth even if I had managed to pull on my yoga pants I wouldn’t have gotten very far after that.</p>
<p>I of course cancelled all my classes but was certainly feeling the withdrawal symptoms of a physical personal practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-709 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I finally did start feeling a bit better, I decided to roll out the mat and take it easy. Some restorative Yin and Yoga Nidra is just what the doctor ordered – only it really wasn’t. I wasn’t feeling nearly as bad as I had previously, but my nose was still blocked and my throat still sore, so forget any consistent breathing.</p>
<p>It felt just…..wrong. Being unable to breathe properly just made me feel really disconnected from my practice, and just rubbish.</p>
<p>I could just about manage a half decent Yoga Nidra practice but to be honest I think that was the medication. Sniffling and coughing your way through even the shortest of meditations just doesn’t have the desired effect and can often make you feel worse.</p>
<p>When you are ill you really need to think twice about attending your regular class.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me when I am feeling unwell or if I am injured – stopping. My practice these days is so disciplined, I just cannot turn it off even if my body forces me to do so. Yes I am sick and yes everything hurts but the worst part is not being able to roll out my mat.</p>
<p>Yoga literally means ‘to yoke’ and to ‘unite’, and when we have a physical practice, a Pranayama practice or meditation session, if we cannot unite our breath with our movement and struggle with our inhales and exhales, then we really have an important ingredient missing from the entire process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-713" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Yet still I have students that attend class when they feel under the weather and even have clients who will still keep their private appointment despite coughing and spluttering the moment I arrive. My group classes are particularly physical, so this really is a bad move if you are not feeling 100%.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-715" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1200x955.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1536x1222.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-800x637.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I’ve had sick students dash out of the room to grab tissues and don’t even get me started on the consequences of Nadi Shodhana on a poorly students’ nasal passages !(gross emoji?)</p>
<p>When you cannot breathe you cannot unite your breath with your movement and your practice then isn’t yoga anymore, it is something else, something more forced and strained and well, unpleasant.</p>
<p>Even if you try a restorative class or a meditation class, our bodies feel heavy and achy, and our minds clouded when we are ill, and quite often you can leave a class feeling worse than before which is the exact opposite of what we are aiming for when we practice yoga.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the reality is, you are full of germs. Think of other people in the class, while we all like to spread the love in our practice that doesn’t extend to your lurgy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="338" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-300x85.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-800x225.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
In gym environments with air conditioning or heated yoga studios this is an environment where germs spread and multiply. Your teacher doesn’t want to catch a cold and neither do your fellow students. When you feel a cold coming on, consider others and skip practice. Respect one another.</p>
<p>I once attended a studio where students were politely asked to leave if they were unwell – and I was really grateful for that rule. As I am my own boss I lose income if I am sick so I try to be extra cautious and while I am sure the sick student wasn’t thrilled at being turned away from class, I was pleased that the studio looked out for its members and teachers. After all they also lose money if they have to cancel a class owing to a teacher being ill. Of course it’s not all about money but it’s most definitely a factor here and it can be frustrating if occasional bouts of illness could be avoided if people were a little more considerate.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-721 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg 281w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1126x1200.jpg 1126w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1441x1536.jpg 1441w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-800x853.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" />B.K.S Iyengar recommends a number of asanas to try when experiencing a variety of different ailments and diseases in his book; <em>Light on Yoga.</em> This handy appendix has often been my go-to when I get students come to me with various issues and problems, but these prescribed asanas do not extend to flu or colds.</p>
<p>If we were supposed to practice asana when full of flu I can’t help but feel Iyengar would have included them in his yoga bible.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor by any stretch but when you are ill, this is your body’s way of telling you to rest and you need to focus on getting better rather than pushing yourself into a practice that could do more damage than good and even prolong the time it takes for you to get better. It’s just common sense.</p>
<p>Hydrate by drinking lots of fluids and consult your pharmacist for some good over-the-counter medication before resorting to anti-biotics. I personally swear by lemon, honey and ginger, herbal teas and Echinacea as well as my trusty bottle of Benylin (always read the label). First thing’s first – look after yourself with a lot of rest.</p>
<p>An extra intake of Vitamin C won’t do you any harm either, so make sure you have some good juice in the fridge and perhaps some multi-vitamins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
When you start feeling a bit better, there is nothing stopping you trying some gentle postures in the comfort of your own home. There are some awesome yoga classes <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">available online</a> as well. See how it feels, but be truthful with yourself at the same time. Just because you are rushing to get back to the mat, put yourself first. An advanced practice is about self- awareness and honesty. For me, a good rule of thumb is that the postures should feel good – nothing more complicated than that. If you are wishing time away and just doing it for the sake of doing it because you would feel guilty otherwise then you are wasting your time on the mat and you need to take it down a notch.</p>
<p>Relish in the experience of winding down and give yourself some self-love. Yoga isn’t going anywhere &#8211; so don’t rush the recovery process and in no time at all you will be fighting fit.</p>
<p>In the meantime – Get well soon yogi!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GO YOU! You’ve finally found a yoga class that you love and a teacher you connect with and have gotten into a routine of getting that cute butt on your mat as often as possible.<br />
And then what? Your yoga teacher only goes and buggers off on holiday/yoga retreat/teacher training/insert other here.<br />
How bloody annoying! Now what are you supposed to do? Sit on the sofa, twiddle one’s thumbs and maybe see what’s new on Netflix. Well here’s another idea… Roll out that mat and develop a wonderful self-practice of your own! Not only will you discover a new level of self-discipline but you will also find self-motivation in your home environment which can be challenging at first, but oh so rewarding if you keep at it.</p>
<p>I feel obliged to write this blog post as I myself am one of those yoga teachers. I’m often away from my students as I have another full time job (like most instructors), that often means I have to travel abroad. I am very fortunate though. The venues I teach at are always incredibly supportive, and the teachers that cover my classes are seriously brilliant, but I’m very aware that for some students they stay at home (not practising) keeping a close eye on my social media to check when I’m back in the country ready to teach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Let’s not forget bank holidays and the Christmas break – it’s absolutely glorious to munch on Lebkuchen and wash it down with a mulled wine while watching Harry Potter, but neglecting a consistent practice can leave you stiff, unbalanced, and well, not quite right.</p>
<p>Your practice doesn’t have to stop because your teacher is away or poorly or if it’s Christmas or summer vacation. First of all, classes are usually covered rather than cancelled (unless it’s last minute or a holiday) and it gives you a beautiful opportunity to experience wisdom from another teacher. I personally love variety. I know what I like and what I don’t but I also love the chance to see how a different teacher operates and sequences a class.</p>
<p>BUT many of us are set in our ways and like our routine – especially us Brits. Therefore a missed class can have more of an impact than just a minor inconvenience. We can feel more stressed and bad tempered without our regular yoga fix.<br />
In my own practice, I usually carve out 2 hours a day for asana and meditation, but when I travel for work this is often impossible. Depending on where I am going and what I am doing, I’m lucky to squeeze in a weekly class which of course massively disrupts my chi.</p>
<p>In my opinion, developing your own practice is essential if you attend classes regularly. Most yogis will practise yoga in some form every day. You only have to look to hard core Ashtangis who are so disciplined they practise 6 days a week.<br />
For the average person who just wants to use yoga for an escape once a week this can be an absurd ask. I often give my students homework but know that less than 10% will actually practice at home.<br />
So what do we do about it?<br />
First of all, figure out realistically how much time you can dedicate to your own practice. Maybe it&#8217;s small pockets of time here and there, or maybe when you really think about it, there is a nice gap one day of the week where you can shut the door and devote that time completely to yourself for some yoga.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-630" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <br />
Work and family life can make this really challenging, but be honest with yourself and work out how much time you can carve out for you. Maybe it means waking up a little earlier to squeeze in a short practice, or hitting the hay a bit later if you need something more restorative.<br />
If you need a little pick me up, even a few rounds of Sun Salutations can energise the body enough for the day ahead, so don’t be so hard on yourself if your free time for a yoga practice isn’t as much as you would like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-642 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Once you have planned in some time for a practice, think about what you would like to work on. Maybe you use the time to work on some skills including more advanced asanas you want to eventually achieve. I personally like to spend more time in my own practice focusing on things that I find more challenging and after a good flow working on more advanced asana allows me to monitor my own progress in strength and flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-645" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you need something more structured you can always look at the plethora of classes available online.<br />
Now your thoughts might instantly be directed to YouTube but I would err on the side of caution here. While there are some amazing instructors on YouTube offering some awesome classes, there is also A LOT of rubbish out there. Quite often you have to trawl through a lot of irrelevant and disappointing classes to find the golden nuggets. I have spent hours finding some good classes on YouTube but to be honest, I only really use it for help with something specific and usually that’s a 5-10 minute tutorial that I use in addition not instead of my practice.<br />
The attraction of YouTube is that it’s free. However, it drives me insane when the adverts pop up and like I said, for me finding a class I love is often like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>What is WAY more effective for me personally is on-demand yoga classes that are taught by my favourite teachers. Yoga teachers whose style I like and who are going to make me feel amazing afterwards. I apply the same attitude as I would when picking a regular yoga class – the teacher matters.<br />
Therefore, if your regular teacher is away and unable to teach your regular class, why not see if they offer a class online? On-demand classes are usually the fraction of the cost of a regular yoga class and you can have them on your computer or smartphone whenever you want them.<br />
For my own personal practice this is the way forward for me. I live in a remote part of the country where advanced classes are quite rare and often what I am personally looking for isn’t available and if it is, it’s at a time when I’m unable to make the class or workshop.<br />
Online classes are also perfect if you are busy and work full time. Fitting in a class at home when it suits you is way more time efficient than hop footing it to class when you factor in how long it takes to get to and from the studio. For example, if I’m teaching a single one hour class it can easily take me two hours minimum and that’s not factoring in the time I like to allow myself before class to greet my students and the time after class to answer any questions. It really doesn’t take a mathematician to work out the time benefits of a home practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
This is one of the main reasons I created my <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. As a teacher I want to reach out to as many people as possible sharing the benefits of my style of teaching as well as offer an alternative to those who, for whatever reason, cannot make it to class. As a student who loves a regular home practice, I wanted to produce classes online that I would want to do, that had enough varied content and useful information to encourage stay-at-home yogis to develop a regular practice wherever they may be.</p>
<p>These awesome online courses when taken together with your regular classes at the studio or the gym result in a beautiful well-rounded practice that will reap benefits of a solid, safe and strong practice which will help you to progress not only physically but mentally as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-647 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-300x193.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-1200x772.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-800x515.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol.jpg 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Another fantastic way to get your yoga fix or even in addition to your regular routine is to find a good yoga podcast. <br />
There are so many incredible teachers who host podcasts full of help and advice on how to deepen your practice, yoga philosophy and even help on how to develop your own practice. When I don&#8217;t have some sci-fi fantasy novel playing on my audible app, I&#8217;m usually listening to a decent yoga podcast. Again, like YouTube some channels I connect with and some I really don&#8217;t, but the beauty of this is that you can expand your knowledge and understanding during your commute or doing daily tasks.</p>
<p>So rather than feel put out if your regular class gets cancelled, check out other options that might work for you. You may just find some online yoga gold, a new community and some awesome new teachers to practice with.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My palms are sweaty, my heart is in my throat, my brain isn&#8217;t working and I feel quite sick.<br />
I&#8217;m surrounded by the sound of hundreds of pens scribbling furiously, while I stare blankly at the paper in front of me that only has my name and the date, and I am not entirely sure I&#8217;ve written that correctly.</p>
<p>Question 1 is an essay question and I&#8217;m pretty sure of the subject but can&#8217;t recall any facts to back up my answer despite cramming the night before on this very topic&#8230;yep, I think I am about to throw up.</p>
<p>&#8216;Vic?&#8230;Vic? I made you a cup of tea&#8217;.<br />
THANK GOODNESS for that. It&#8217;s the boyfriend waking me up. It was just a dream &#8211; a nightmare actually, but I remember all too well that dreaded exam time at school and university.</p>
<p>I was a good student and I worked pretty hard but the harsh reality was that my memory was pants. My peers seemed naturally gifted and I felt I was putting in two hours of study for every hour everyone else put in and it just sucked. At the time, it felt like the whole world was on my shoulders and my entire future rested on whether or not I could remember the right law case or correct Trigonometry formula. Don&#8217;t even get me started on essays &#8211; I was rubbish at writing essays.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />I don&#8217;t think I will ever forget the stress surrounding exams and tests &#8211; even non-academic ones. The evening before my driving test I suddenly had a panic attack forgetting what lane I needed to be in for going straight on a roundabout and before I knew it I had smoked an entire packet of cigarettes in an attempt to calm down (I hadn&#8217;t smoked for years). Needless to say it did not help my stress levels and in fact helped me develop a hoarse cough that took a month to shift.</p>
<p>Oh how I wish I had discovered yoga back then. I can&#8217;t help but feel that had I taken that time out for myself to calm down and relax I would have found exam time so much easier.<br />
The pressure I put on myself to do well and a need to make sure that I didn&#8217;t disappoint anyone around me just brought on a level of anxiety that was just off the scale.<br />
If I was ever advised to take time off I would always be afraid that it meant time away from the books which was vital time wasted where I could be learning another topic.</p>
<p>Of course, now I am older and wiser I realise I went about it all wrong. Breaks are important and while I did pretty well at school and university I can&#8217;t help but feeling that had I taken more time to look after myself I would have done better.<br />
Just as I write this, I am having a small flashback to my uni days in the weeks leading up to my dissertation deadline. I was living in the computer lab wrapped in a sleeping back surviving off salt and vinegar Pringles and bacon sandwiches &#8211; hardly brain food. Such an idiot.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-446" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-1200x728.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-800x485.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1.jpg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Just like a good Savasana at the end of class gives the body a chance to recover and observe all the sensations of the class, we need to apply this STOP and EVALUATE method to life, particularly when faced with stressful situations like exam time.</p>
<p>It is so important to develop good habits and look after your mind and body &#8211; even more so when you are studying. It will feel like time is short and you just don&#8217;t have time, but time out doing something worthwhile (like yoga) will mean when you return to study you will feel more energised and way less stressed.</p>
<p>This is why I have developed a brand new yoga course designed at combatting stress and increasing focus and attention. As well as making sure you get enough sleep and eat the right foods, trying something like this yoga will help to calm the mind and help the body relax and recharge for the next time you hit the books.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-455" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />If you are interested in finding out more about our 1-2-1 sessions or would like to bring these wonderful classes to your school or college, contact us via the website or comment below and we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>Yoga cannot guarantee your A* or First, but it can help create the mind space for you to find an easier path to achieve better results with much less stress. What have you got to lose?</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>Fabulous <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You are now technically SAVING money as you no longer need to join the yoga studio down the street. That&#8217;s hard earned pennies back in the pocket.<br />
Or is it?</p>
<p>Admittedly this post is based on my experience and own research, but from what I know and have learnt there is a big difference between yoga classes in a gym and classes at a designated studio. </p>
<p><strong><em>Focus in a gym is to keep fit and stretch</em></strong></p>
<p>As most of you studio yogis know, there is more to yoga than the physical focus. In a gym class people want to feel like they have worked hard whether that&#8217;s through sweating or stretching every muscle they possibly can. I have found that most classes I have attended in a gym tend to fit into the &#8216;power yoga&#8217; category or they are very much a stretching session. Both are great but they only touch the surface of what yoga is actually about and studio classes offer the opportunity to explore the more spiritual and mindful side to your practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>A well varied studio schedule will have dedicated pranayama classes as well as restorative options to balance the yin and yang of your yoga experience. While this isn&#8217;t for everyone, I can say that my mindful yoga journey quite often outweighs the benefits of my physical journey. </p>
<p><em><strong>Gym yoga classes tend to be more informal </strong></em></p>
<p>Yoga classes in a gym will rarely use sanskrit. As a teacher, I always use sanskrit as well as the &#8216;english&#8217; name of the poses regardless of where I am teaching purely out of habit but my students in the gym often laugh at my use of &#8216;funny&#8217; words to explain what pose we are currently practising. It&#8217;s not something that strikes me as that important but as a student if I know the name of the pose and I hear the incorrect name even in English it does make me sometimes question the authenticity of the teacher I am learning from. Whether this matters in a gym class and to the ordinary student just wanting a stretch I don&#8217;t know, but in my experience, a good yoga teacher should at least know what Warrior pose is!</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-339 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust-300x237.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust-800x633.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There is also less focus on proper alignment in a gym class. This does frustrate me as I was taught that in order to practise safely you need to have a good knowledge of alignment principles, particularly if you are attending classes regularly. Again, this is something I do teach whether in a gym or a studio purely on the basis to help others avoid injury. I like to adjust as this is how I was taught, but a hands-on approach tends not to happen in a gym and is more a &#8216;follow the teacher&#8217; situation. Of course this is absolutely fine, but having experienced hands on adjustment as a student myself, I know I prefer to have that little extra help and guidance I sometimes can&#8217;t find by myself.</p>
<p>There is also no requirement to arrive early for a class in the gym. If people arrive late it&#8217;s ok, and there is no need for pre meditation or relaxation before a class starts. I have even had students have their phones go off which is something that doesn&#8217;t really happen in a studio. There are usually strict rules about leaving phones in lockers and switched off and I have even been in classes where they lock the door as soon as class starts not allowing anyone to enter to disturb others once the class begins. This was in a studio in China as I think a few people would have fire safety concerns if that happened in this country.</p>
<p><em><strong>The atmosphere is different</strong></em></p>
<p>As soon as you walk into a yoga studio I give it 30 seconds before you find a buddha statue, an &#8216;ohm&#8217; sign or the smell of incense, or of course all three. There is a sense you are in a place not quite ordinary anymore. </p>
<p>More often than not, in a studio you are asked to leave your shoes at the entrance and people talk quietly respecting others&#8217; need for quiet meditation before practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>In a gym, this is definitely not the case. Life is &#8216;normal&#8217; so to speak and the smell is usually of sweat and sound of people pounding the running machines and the ellipticals &#8211; definitely less &#8216;zen&#8217; but then it&#8217;s a gym and people are there for more reasons than yoga. I love that sense of calm you get before a class begins and have been known to turn up to class even half an hour early (yes I&#8217;m that student!), especially if I am joining a hot yoga or Bikram class. I use the time to open up my shoulders and whatever area happens to be tight that day finishing with some &#8216;me&#8217; time. Everything feels quiet and at peace, a feeling that is very hard to cultivate these days.</p>
<p>The air conditioning is usually on quite high in a gym especially the fancier, bigger chains. Yoga studios tend to be warmer and if you are practising Bikram the temperature is even HOT. This helps relax the muscles to access deeper stretches and for my own personal preference I love a warmer environment when I practise but I can&#8217;t deny to occasionally turning on the Dyson fan during a challenging power yoga session. It is hard to get the temperature right for classes in a gym. Compared to that of a studio, people only practise yoga whereas you may have a yoga class in a gym that is immediately followed by Spinning and you need to feel as cool as possible if you ever decide to try that.</p>
<p><em><strong>Class Length and Type</strong></em></p>
<p>Gym classes usually take place first thing in the morning before the working day and again around 4pm for those finishing a day at the office. They are at &#8216;peak&#8217; times unless you are really lucky and are members of a gym where classes are non-stop throughout the day. </p>
<p>The classes take place one after the other with no time before or after like an &#8216;in and out&#8217; system. They are usually 45 minutes long or an hour and very rarely longer than that. A yoga studio class is anything from an hour to 90 minutes, sometimes even 2 hours with Mysore being even longer.</p>
<p>In a gym, class type is quite limited. It is either a power yoga class with a core focus or a flexibility style class with a stretch focus. There are so many more styles of yoga than that. By joining a yoga studio you have access to so many more styles and while some types of yoga do overlap in terms of style they each have their own distinct methods and way of learning.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, I was fortunate to have an unlimited membership at My Soul Yoga Studio and it opened my eyes to how many different classes were available. My beautiful studio was open at least 14 hours daily and still didn&#8217;t cover all the styles that exist. As a passionate yogini I was in my element and my experience there opened my eyes to so much yoga. My membership allowed me to try as many different styles as I physically could and which classes I loved and which were not quite suited to me and ultimately led me on a path to the teacher training. Happy days <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I began my journey thinking it was all about getting a nice stretch with the occasional contortionist challenge, but realise it is so much more than that and even if I had 100 lifetimes I still wouldn&#8217;t be able to master all I wanted to. It is a very humbling concept and I actually quite like that even though I am a teacher and love sharing what I know about yoga, I will still always be a student on a constant path of learning and self discovery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Props and equipment </strong></em></p>
<p>In a studio, you will be spoilt for choice for props. You want 4 blocks, 2 straps and a bolster? No problem, help yourself. You know how tight your body is and what you need in your practice on any given day so you &#8216;prop up&#8217; accordingly. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-381" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy-800x450.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In a gym props aren&#8217;t really available and if they are people do not know how to use them. There isn&#8217;t really a need for bolsters as classes are not usually restorative. If the gym is well equipped there will be straps and maybe even some blocks but this doesn&#8217;t happen very often. Just bear in mind if you do like using props in your practice, then it may be worth investing in your own if you are joining a gym yoga class but see what your gym has before you part with your hard earned cash.</p>
<p>Another issue that has come up during my gym yoga classes is that of mats. As a teacher, I am very particular about the mat I practise on and so usually use my own. Like anything, equipment gets used ALOT and it goes without saying it is always better to have your own mat. There is loads of information online about choosing a mat and you can spend as little or as much as you like. We would all like to think mats get cleaned regularly but not only yogis are using mats. The mats are for everyone &#8211; even those lifting weights wearing their not-so-clean trainers.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean to say studio mats are any better. Regardless of where you are practising, mats wear out and often have been used by many people. If you don&#8217;t fancy investing in a mat I would recommend buying a decent yoga towel to put on top of your mat. That way, when the teacher guides you into a Child&#8217;s Pose you don&#8217;t need to hold your breath when your face is so close to the mat. </p>
<p><strong><em>Improving your level</em></strong></p>
<p>A yoga studio schedule will have a number of different styles but there will also be a guide about the level a class is pitched at whether it be Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced or suitable for all levels. There will be modifications for any class you try but it is quite nice to be able to choose what level you want to practise at and whether you want to be challenged. In my old studio there were even some classes where you had to ask permission from the instructor to join and he/she would decide whether you were ready to join a higher level class.</p>
<p>If you attend a studio class regularly, you are likely to progress more as your teacher will get to know you and your abilities and help you improve your practice and as a result, your level. </p>
<p>Gym yoga classes will be suitable for all levels unless they stipulate otherwise. They have to be because they are catering for everyone &#8211; all ages, different levels of fitness and flexibility. I have sometimes found I need to up the ante for a deeper stretch as I know what my body needs but I am lucky as I know what options are available in any given pose. In a mixed level class some will be challenged and unsure how to use props to help them with their progression, and those more flexible but &#8216;stuck&#8217; on a pose because a deeper option hasn&#8217;t been made available and again stuck at the same level unable to progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Savasana</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-382" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-800x534.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Savasana is the most important pose in any practice, but is often missed out in a gym class, partly because time is so short or most people attending the class are also checked in for the next one so the last thing they want to do is completely relax.</p>
<p>In a studio you can expect your Savasana to be anything from 5-15 minutes and often ending with the class chanting Ohm or maybe there is some sort of singing bowl action. This truly is a wonderful way to end your practice and one I personally prefer. It helps seal in the benefits and bring you back to the present in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>Many people do not understand Savasana and it&#8217;s importance. During my gym sessions people often get up and leave early which I get as there are people to see and places to go, but it does disturb others and something I would not encourage particularly if I was teaching in a studio.</p>
<p><em><strong>So which is best?</strong></em></p>
<p>To be honest, &#8216;best&#8217; is probably a bad way to phrase it and of course it depends on personal choice. If there isn&#8217;t much yoga in your area, gym classes provide a wonderful opportunity to experience an introductory avenue into yoga and whether it is something you want to explore further.</p>
<p>While I am reluctant to talk about &#8216;authenticity&#8217; as it potentially sounds like I am implying one option is not, it is true to say that your experience in a studio feels more so. </p>
<p>As for what is better that is purely down to you. Many find the spiritual atmosphere of a studio intimidating and off putting while others feel a gym class is more focused on burning calories than the actual yoga journey. </p>
<p>At the end of the day if you have joined a gym and your classes are free try it out and enjoy as you have nothing to lose, but don&#8217;t close yourself off from experiencing yoga in a studio as it is very different. Broaden your horizons and get as much variety in your yoga as you possibly can &#8211; your mind and body will thank you for it.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first 10 minutes of every morning is usually the same, unless of course I am frantically rushing around to catch sunrise for a photography workshop and then its a case of finding pants rather than looking at my phone.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-303" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news-300x200.jpg" alt="coffee-newspaper-news" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coffee-newspaper-news.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I wake up and after a few curses to the alarm clock I check my emails and catch up with the national news. My standard precursor to ensure I get at least another few moments in my cosy bed. </p>
<p>I often question why I even bother to read the news. It only ever puts me in a bad mood and I get sick and tired of the propaganda and of course everyone has an opinion on everyone and everything. Political madness, the world at war, tragedies and accidents aplenty, poverty, pain, and sadly quite often, downright evil. If the last year or so has taught us anything it seems that even the unexpected should be expected, and if nothing else we truly are a world divided more often than not. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-304 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/news-tragedy-media.jpg" alt="news-tragedy-media" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/news-tragedy-media.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/news-tragedy-media-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/news-tragedy-media-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>I am super reluctant to talk about this kind of stuff. My social media deliberately remains unpolitical as I mainly like to keep things as lighthearted as possible. Although no doubt my online friends are beyond bored of my 600th picture of a glass of wine in the sun, the standard &#8216;I&#8217;m off abroad&#8217; selfie or a new yoga pose I found online, but hey at least I am not bumming anyone out.</p>
<p>Anyone with a Facebook account really cannot avoid the news. We all have friends who share a news post announcing the death of a beloved celebrity or some catastrophic event that seems to succeed in dividing us more than it should. Within minutes of a tragedy or some sort of attack the entire world knows about it, ready to form very quick opinions and often choosing anger over any feeling that actually helps. </p>
<p>There are people however, who actually show that human beings are capable of extraordinary love even when for many it is hard to rise up in the face of something truly terrible. I&#8217;m not talking about those who change their profile pictures to a relevant symbol or flag and express condolences through social media &#8211; I am talking about the people that actually DO something. Those people who offer their homes as a safe house to strangers when some madman has decided to blow himself up, or those people who run towards danger hoping to provide comfort or assistance to those in dire need of it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-306" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/support-love-helping.jpg" alt="support-love-helping" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/support-love-helping.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/support-love-helping-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/support-love-helping-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>If the last few months has taught me anything, it&#8217;s taught me to be more like those people. I will try to love more, even when I am angry. I will try to help more, especially those who are worse off than myself. My door will be open to those who need it and I will aim to be a better, more giving person.</p>
<p>This starts with my new Charity Yoga Project which will not only aim to raise much needed money for worthy causes but also helps more people get involved with yoga. On Father&#8217;s Day this year we ran our first Charity Yoga class for Dorset charity <a href="https://www.juliashouse.org">Julia&#8217;s House Hospice</a>. There is no fixed price for a class, people can just turn up and pay whatever they like to join the class. ALL proceeds then go to charity. </p>
<p>This really is a cool way to bring the local community together and gives people a taste of the wonderful world of yoga. Get together, get healthy and do something great for charity. We need to balance all the bad stuff we hear about everyday with something truly good. I need to read more happy stories over my morning cuppa!</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-308 size-thumbnail" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hand-support-each-other-150x150.jpg" alt="hand-support-each-other" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hand-support-each-other-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hand-support-each-other-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Are you a charity looking for help fundraising? Maybe you are part of a support group who feel that yoga would help your members? Maybe you are a company who are looking to do a charity event yourselves? <a href="http://info@sidayoga.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get in touch</a> and maybe we can assist you with your next event! Whoever you are and whatever your story, we would like to hear from you.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make the world a better place, one asana at a time!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can often happen with blogs, and has done here, is sometimes there can be large gaps since the previous post. Firstly, I apologise profusely and I promise you I haven&#8217;t been slacking. A mammoth photography trip to New Zealand has kept me rather busy for the last month and therefore a tad rubbish in the blog department. Although I did manage to squeeze in some excellent yoga classes on my trip despite the countless sunrise shoots I had to wake up for. </p>
<p>New Zealand is truly a fantastic place though. My partner <a href="http://www.paulreiffer.com">Paul Reiffer</a> and I were running a photography workshop out there and the extensive opportunities for shooting are simply breathtaking. I feel like I have aged about ten years with the late nights and early starts and was sometimes grumpy with the lack of yoga, but it really is a place that should be on everyone&#8217;s bucket list. If the scenery can&#8217;t convince you (see pictures) then the food and wine has to. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga.jpg" alt="NewZealandblogyoga" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now for some exciting news. Drum roll please! Next week I begin teaching at the <a href="http://www.dorchesteryoga.co.uk">Dorchester Yoga and Therapy Centre</a>. I am running a 5 week course that will focus on TAV and Restorative Yoga.</p>
<p>TAV is an abbreviated term for Therapeutic Alignment Vinyasa and is one of my favourite styles of yoga to practise and teach because it allows you to explore poses a little deeper than a faster-paced yoga class. The idea is that by focusing on alignment you can connect more to each asana and become more aware of space and your place in it. Your practice becomes easier and a lot stronger.</p>
<p>Restorative yoga is perfect for those who want a break from their hectic schedules and need to take time out for themselves. This style of yoga takes you on a journey of deep relaxation where the focus is on the breath and calming the body and the mind. Only a handful of poses are performed during the sequence as they are each held for an extended period of time &#8211; sometimes up to 10 minutes a pose. While the poses themselves are not physically difficult and can be done without too much muscle strength, the challenge is staying in the present and allowing yourself to relax. Classes can help relieve the nervous system, improve focus and release muscle tension &#8211; basically a spa treatment without the expensive bill at the end. Bonus!</p>
<p>I am really excited about teaching at such a fantastic venue. The Dorchester Yoga and Therapy Centre has such a lovely vibe about it, and the smell of incense as you walk in is like a big hug. The studio is extremely spacious with lots of natural light and there are plenty of mats, bolsters and other yoga props available. There are also some other really great classes on the <a href="http://www.dorchesteryoga.co.uk/timetable/">timetable</a> &#8211; lots of variety so there really is something for everyone.</p>
<p>I am a teacher who likes to plan, and these days you will find me in my office/studio furiously scribbling down sequences and exercises. I like to be prepared. I like to know that a class I have planned is balanced, challenging and has an intention. To be honest that is probably the hardest part for me. I know in my own practice and classes I participate in, I like to be pushed beyond my limits and love sequences and exercises that are outside the norm, but not everyone is like that. </p>
<p>Everyone has a different idea about what they want to get out of a class. When I first started going to yoga classes my intention was to improve my flexibility so I could kick ass in my dance classes. Now, I find myself not giving too hoots about that and focused more on facing head on the poses I once feared. That for me is what&#8217;s so exciting about yoga. There is always an extra step you can take and the learning is constant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga.jpg" alt="groupclassyoga" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>My 5 week course that starts next Tuesday will focus on a different aspect of Therapeutic Alignment in each class. While I will use more than one alignment cue for every pose, the idea is that by focusing on one aspect per session, by the end of the course students will be well versed in a number of alignment hints and be practising each one as if it were second nature. Thus, improving their own level and ability. You will become more focused, more aware and connected deeper to your practice.</p>
<p>More details and prices are available on the <a href="http://www.sidayoga.com/classes/">class</a> page and also check out my previous blog post if you haven&#8217;t already, about what to bring to a yoga class and how to prepare. </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Come and join me for a fabulous yoga journey! </p>
<p>Namaste</p>
