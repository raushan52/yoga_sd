								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s here!!!!! It&#8217;s International Yoga Day!</p>
<p>For most people its the start of summer being the longest day of the year and all, but for those that regularly roll out their mat it&#8217;s a day the yoga community come together and mark the occasion with special classes and events.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-505" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3499-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />This special day has been recognised since 2015 and was first proposed by India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his UN address in September 2014 and is recognised as a way of promoting peace, harmony and of course health all over the world &#8211; kinda cool eh?</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to spend my morning with a couple of regular clients as well as my Friday class at Anytime Fitness in Dorchester. The sun was shining and we spent our time practising Yin Yoga at the wall stretching the entire body &#8211; a beautiful way to celebrate the International Day of Yoga, but also a fabulous way to end the week and get re-energised for the weekend.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-507" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3505-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />I have then spent the rest of my day luxuriating in my own practice, focusing on opening my shoulders and stretching parts of my body that needed some much-needed TLC. Ending with some Pranayama and you will find me in my best mood&#8230;..ever.</p>
<p>Another wonderful thing about this day is that many awesome yoga brands have discounts. So if you need a new yoga mat or want to update your yogadrobe (so copyrighting that!) then now is the time. Here is my quick rundown of a few of my favourite brands that are currently offering discounts on their sites. But hurry, some of these offers are only valid for this special day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogarebel.com"><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogarebel.com"><strong>Yoga Rebel</strong></a></p>
<p>Save 25% on all your favourite yoga brands as Yoga Rebel are offering this amazing discount on EVERYTHING &#8211; including their outlet. It&#8217;s a really great opportunity to buy from brands like Alo Yoga where you don&#8217;t risk the customs charges and you can save money on higher priced brands. Just use the code &#8216;YOGADAY25&#8217;. Annoyingly, I am likely to spend a lot of money hereÂ  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f615.png" alt="ðŸ˜•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Â </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sweatybetty.com/shop/reversible-high-waisted-7-8-yoga-leggings-SB4560_NightFernPrint.html?cgid=shop&amp;dwvar_SB4560__NightFernPrint_color=nightfernprint&amp;tile=13#prefn1=product-type&amp;prefv1=All+Bottoms&amp;start=13"><strong>Sweaty Betty</strong></a></p>
<p>Sweaty Betty are doing something very different here. You can save 50% for one day only on one of their favourite items but you have to find &#8216;Betty&#8217;&#8230;. I have done the hard work for you and found the item, just click the link above and it will take you to the half priced leggings. But hurry, at that discount the sizes will sell out fast!Â <strong>Â </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freespirit.co"><strong>Free Spirit</strong></a></p>
<p>For one day only Free Spirit are offering 20% off using discount code &#8216;YOGADAY20&#8217;.Â </p>
<p>Free Spirit never do sales, aside from Earth Day and Yoga Day and this is something I really respect in the brand. What&#8217;s wonderful about this company is their ethos &#8211; they are passionate about our planet and use sustainable materials in their clothing. Check out their ECO range online &#8211; leggings made from plastic bottles! There is no downside here! Look fabulous in your new gear and help save our planet &#8211; Mr Attenborough would be proud!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogamatters.com"><strong>Yogamatters</strong></a></p>
<p>This fabulous online yoga retailer sells absolutely everything you need to get started in your yoga practice. From mats, towels, and bags through to props, clothing and even essential oils and tea! A great place for all your essentials and even a little extra. Today, Yogamatters are offering 20% off all Manduka and Yogamatters products. No code needed, just visit the site above and click on the link and it will take your right to the products on sale!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.liforme.com"><strong>Liforme</strong></a></p>
<p>These mats are like no other. These mats I use for my own personal practice. I love my Manduka mats as their durability is just wonderful, but for anyone working on Alignment or needing a more grippy mat for a practice that consists of a lot of arm balancing and inversions, then this is the mat for you. Personally, given the price I wouldn&#8217;t invest in these mats unless you are serious about your practice or certainly practicing regularly. What sets these mats apart for me is first and foremost the grip, but also these mats are PVC-free and biodegradable. YAY! Today save 10% on Liforme mats using code &#8216;YOGADAY2019&#8217;. What&#8217;s more, Liforme are donatingÂ 5% of all sales during the day to charity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oysho.com/gb/oyshosport.html"><strong>Oysho</strong></a></p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a specific discount for Yoga Day but there is a 50% sale on Oysho at the moment. I have to say their leggings are so chic and I love the printed graphics on their sportswear as well. One thing I will say, is in my experience the sizes are a tad &#8216;snug&#8217;. So you may want to consider going up a size or buying two sizes to see what works.Â </p>
<p><a href="https://thesportsedit.com/pages/sale"><strong>The Sports Edit</strong></a></p>
<p>Finally, not specific to Yoga Day, but The Sports Edit currently have an amazing sale on they activewear. You can save on brands like Adidas, Under Armour and Spiritual Gangster. I have my eye on a few items in this sale&#8230;.it&#8217;s going to be an expensive month&#8230;sigh</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/"><strong>sida yoga</strong></a></p>
<p>As I am plugging all these other brands, I may as well mention myself as well! Today I launched my online shop in honour of International Yoga Day. As I start to grow my product range, we start off with a gorgeous little piece of handmade artwork for your yoga room or studio. Hand-stitched in an interchangeable frame this would make a lovely gift for someone or even yourselfÂ  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Â </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do today, I hope International Yoga Day is magic and glorious!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>
