								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing a yoga mat is as personal as choosing a watch or a new pair of shoes (in my opinion).</p>
<p>A number of factors determine which one you buy, whether that be budget, eco-friendly manufacturing procedures or grip.</p>
<p>I look for two main things when purchasing a yoga mat. I need really good grip (I do get my sweat on), and I need it to wear well, although this isn&#8217;t as important as grip.</p>
<p>My first &#8216;proper&#8217; yoga mat was a Lululemon mat and I still recommend those mats to clients. During my teacher training back in 2015 one of my friends had a Liforme Mat. I marvelled at the AlignForMe<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> system and must admit I had mat envy, but I almost choked on my tea when I learnt the price. It was more than twice what I paid for mine and I dismissed getting one immediately.</p>
<p>Roll on two years later and a generous visit from Santa Claus and hey presto I had one and I was over the moon. </p>
<p>I wanted to review this mat for you, as I get many students ask me about what mat I use and the <a href="https://liforme.com/products/liforme-yoga-mat-grey">Liforme mat</a> is my go-to for my daily home practice. It was good timing too, as I had just bought a new one so we could compare and contrast the wear and tear as well.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>THE GRIP IS AMAZING</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The grip on my Liforme mat is just brilliant and I&#8217;ve put this bad boy through its paces. It&#8217;s been to countless hot yoga classes and even a 3 hour workshop in a hot room my trusty mat never failed. I absolutely love this mat for arm balancing and inversions as I feel a bit more supported. Even if I am sweating, I still feel safe balancing on my hands.</p>
<p>The grip is so good, it can take some time to get used to for Vinyasa, especially Chaturanga to Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana. This doesn&#8217;t bother me especially, but could niggle hard core Ashtangis in the beginning.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>THE ALIGNFORME<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> SYSTEM </strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-853" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme3-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" />This is perfect for a beginner or someone who does the majority of their <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">yoga practice at home</a>. It has been meticulously designed for all sorts of body shapes and heights, but make sure you don&#8217;t fall victim to the &#8216;all the gear no idea&#8217; syndrome. Even with the markers, you need to use them according to your body.</p>
<p>I use the hand markers slightly differently to the recommendations as I like using the lower hand marker to align my wrists. This works really nicely for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful feature is the central line. Admittedly there is nothing stopping you taking a <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2016/03/alignment-connection-rather-than-correction/">sharpie to your standard mat</a>, but people tend to be less than keen to deface their stuff. </p>
<p>I personally love this <a href="https://liforme.com/pages/align-for-me">system</a>. When used correctly it can help with a really safe and steady practice when you don&#8217;t have access to adjustment. The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">Coronavirus</a> outbreak means I am only verbal cuing in my classes and avoiding physical adjustment, so if there was ever a time to buy this mat, it&#8217;s now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>BIODEGRADABLE &amp; PVC FREE</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Liforme have spent a lot of time, money and effort to produce a high-quality, eco-friendly mat. It&#8217;s PVC-free and apparently biodegrades in landfill within 1-5 years, which is actually brilliant. It&#8217;s non-toxic and doesn&#8217;t have that horrid &#8216;new mat&#8217; smell when you first open it up.</p>
<p>I love this and it&#8217;s nice to know my yoga practice and slight mat purchasing addiction isn&#8217;t ruining the planet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>LARGER THAN A STANDARD MAT</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually didn&#8217;t realise that the Liforme mats were slightly longer and wider than standard yoga mats. This is great if you are taller than average. A quick Google search tells me the standard mat measures about 172 cm long and 60cm wide. Liforme mats measure 185cm long and 68cm wide so that&#8217;s some significant inch gain right there.</p>
<p>If you are super tall like my fella, you may want to look at a mat that has been designed accordingly. <a href="https://eu.manduka.com/products/manduka-pro-yoga-mat?variant=30199675256883">Manduka</a> offer a mat for sale that measures up to 215cm long which is ideal for tall folks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>CHARITY DONATIONS</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love a company that gives back? By purchasing from their <a href="https://liforme.com/collections/giving-back">Purple Earth, White Magic or Zodiac</a> range, a percentage of profits goes to <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk">Friends of the Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk">RSPCA</a>.</p>
<h3>CONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>PRICEY</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cheapest standard yoga mat available is currently £80 as Liforme are offering a discount until tomorrow. This is definitely on the pricier end of the mat-buying spectrum, and those that have a strict budget might not be able to justify the higher price tag. Perhaps you only attend one or two classes a week and just won&#8217;t get the &#8216;value-for-use&#8217;.</p>
<p>Personally, I think you get what you pay for. I use my mat everyday so I need the best mat I can afford. The Liforme mats are worth every penny in my opinion, but if too pricey look for offers throughout the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>ANT FOOD</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These mats are basically chocolate pudding for ants! They are biodegradable which is awesome, but when using outside they attract the bugs.</p>
<p>Last October I took my Liforme mat with me to a stunning Shala where it was all open plan &#8211; think at one with nature. However, it didn&#8217;t take long for my mat to attract any creepy crawly within walking distance. </p>
<p>It did affect me a bit as I was forever swatting and pushing them off my mat which was a little annoying. At first, I couldn&#8217;t work out why I was an ant-magnet. Then I noticed my originally-pristine mat was now pretty damaged as the result of a Mad Anter&#8217;s Tea Party.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I&#8217;d rather have a planet-friendly mat than be too bothered about the damage but it is a bit of a bugger when you think how much the mats are in the first place.</p>
<p>My damaged one will now be my dedicated outdoor mat for the summer, as I now have a spare. If you only have one mat, consider using something else outside or use super strong insect repellant. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>WEARS AND ATTRACTS MARKS</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the Manduka mats I have purchased, the Liforme mats wear a little more. Personally, I still think the wearing out is pretty excellent and as I buy the grey mats I don&#8217;t notice the dirt as much. </p>
<p>Liforme have just launched a <a href="https://liforme.com/products/liforme-white-magic-mat">White Magic mat</a>, which is simply a stunning work of art. I do however worry about how this mat might look in a few months time. Although, having said that, the team at Liforme have taken measures to reduce this issue so I guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>Personally I love black and I clean my mat religiously so it&#8217;s not a huge issue for me, but the Mrs Hinch wannabes might struggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><strong><em>BAG STRAP IS UNCOMFORTABLE</em></strong></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-863" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme5-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></em></strong><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Although the bag is complimentary, I&#8217;m not really a fan. Where they have placed the clip fastening for me is extremely uncomfortable. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">How I carry the bag, this clip sits right on my shoulder and it just digs in. Maybe I have super sensitive shoulders, but I&#8217;d rather the clip be the other end as the padding is fixed so I can&#8217;t move it. </span></p>
<p>To be honest, this is my home practice mat and I only really take it out the house for workshops or trainings, so again not a huge issue for me, but could annoy those with sensitive shoulders &#8211; like me.</p>
<p>The bag is also complimentary with the mat purchase but I wanted to mention it as it is annoying.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>ONLY ONE THICKNESS (4.2mm)</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">If you are super sensitive on the knees or joints, the 4.2mm thickness on these mats </span><em style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">might </em><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">not be enough for you.</span></p>
<p>Personally, if you suffer from knee sensitivity, I would suggest buying separate knee pads anyway. A small towel or blanket can also do the job here. </p>
<p>However, if you don&#8217;t want to be buying extra kit, you may want to look at thicker mats available. The cushioning on the Liforme mats is great, but I don&#8217;t suffer from pain in my knees so it&#8217;s difficult to advise here. If you need more padding though, Manduka do offer 6mm thick mats as well as a whopping 8mm thick yoga mat. </p>
<h3>OVERALL</h3>
<p>8.5-9/10</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-865" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-300x253.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-1200x1012.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-1536x1295.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-2048x1727.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-800x674.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ve only deducted points for the ant issue, price and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t wear as well as other mats I&#8217;ve bought.</p>
<p>However, this is THE mat I will always recommend especially if you love alignment, inversions and arm balancing.</p>
<p>The grip is insanely good and if you mainly have a home practice, it is a must-buy. Plus, it&#8217;s also nice to know that my practice isn&#8217;t damaging the planet &#8211; a few ants here and there is a small sacrifice I guess 😉</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1071495136-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As a yoga teacher I hear and see this all the time; &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing that&#8217; or &#8216;My legs/torso/arms/(insert other here) are too short/long&#8217;. Or, I get the quiet ones who just tend to look at me in horror waiting for the challenge to be over and we move on to something more accessible.</p>
<p>Unless you have an injury or a similar reason for not being able to do the posture or challenge, then I always expect my students to at least give it a go. &#8216;Just try&#8217; I say.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-735 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-848216056-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Sometimes students fall or lose balance and I smile and say &#8216;That&#8217;s awesome! That shows me you went for it&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t try, you will be forever stuck where you are, unable to progress and running away from challenges rather than facing them. I try to encourage my students to take what they learn on the mat, away with them off the mat. If what you learnt from your class that day was to stick your head in the stand and shy away from a posture then that&#8217;s not really what I want you to take away from my class. I want you to feel empowered, strong and wanting to do more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-745 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png 290w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1158x1200.png 1158w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-800x829.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920.png 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>I also HATE the word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; in an asana practice. Instead, I explain to my class&#8230;it&#8217;s just &#8216;not yet&#8217;. This is the mantra I try to repeat as often as possible to those students who just feel stuck and run away. I find this re-phrasing tends to resonate with people more than me putting my strict teacher face on. I like to give an example of something that they can do today that they couldn&#8217;t do before. The simplest example I can think of is walking. We cannot walk from birth, this is something we learn to do. It may take us 9 months to a year (or even longer) of falling on our backsides before we take our first steps, but it happens with time and patience, and it&#8217;s really as simple as that.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to asanas you currently find impossible to achieve. We live in a world where many of us want instant gratification and quite often, we don&#8217;t want to put in the hard work required to nail the posture. What&#8217;s even worse is when it can take years to make even the smallest shift to progress.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, some students can take the &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach. &#8216;I can&#8217;t get there right now so why bother?&#8217; </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-753 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
It can feel disheartening when you can&#8217;t yet do something. Especially when the shape looks simple enough. It&#8217;s very easy to take the &#8216;can&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do&#8217; route, when I can guarantee there is a possible path to the posture that will work for you right now. Take the modifications and make use of props and yoga toys to make yourself feel supported in the posture. Find <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">tutorials online</a> to help give you ideas on how you can make a posture more accessible. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-749 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1171447238-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Something that one of my favourite yogis <a href="https://www.elvisgarciayoga.com">Elvis Garcia</a> mentioned in one of his online classes I took years ago, still sticks with me today; &#8216;Any part of the pose is still the pose&#8217;. I absolutely LOVE this and it&#8217;s so so true. Let&#8217;s take the example of Bakasana (Crow pose). Even working on lifting your hips higher from Malasana pose while you plant the hands is still <em>part</em> of the pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feet stay on the ground or not. We are training our bodies into the shape of the posture and working our muscle memory so we get one step closer to our goal. You can still engage the bandhas and find the correct protraction of the shoulders even with the feet firmly planted on the ground. Sitting on your butt and willing the moment to pass, <i>isn&#8217;t </i>part of the pose and you will never get there in a month of Sundays. If something is holding you back figure out what that is and work with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s a fear of falling in which case <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sidayoga/videos/1652540961451389/">pad the space around you</a> with as many pillows you can find, and then just fall. A soft landing with arm balances can really help take the fear out of the attempt, which might be the very thing holding you back.</p>
<p>I am a curvy girl with boobs and I&#8217;ve had teachers tell me some postures will never be in my repertoire. Well poo to that! Certain postures might not come as easy to me as others, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up. I&#8217;m going to work with the goods God gave me and make it work, and you know what &#8211; this hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>Get out of your head. Just because thousands of people on Instagram can do that handstand you can&#8217;t quite nail yet, don&#8217;t be under any illusion. They probably had to work their a$$es off to get there. Strength drills, flexibility exercises, shoulder opening and dedication&#8230;every day. That famous yoga <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yogaeverydamnday/?hl=en">hashtag</a> exists for a reason!</p>
<p>And guys and gals please&#8230; there is NO SUCH THING AS CAN&#8217;T &#8211; just NOT YET!</p>
<p>Start thinking like Frodo and get your Fellowship together and start that long journey. Just like the Fellowship, you will have some serious hurdles to climb, and perhaps you will often feel like giving up, but commit yourself to the process. You won&#8217;t save Middle Earth, but I can guarantee you will feel incredible when you eventually realise the goals that you feel are impossible today. In fact, the longer the journey, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when you finally get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Here is my advice on how to <del>save Middle Earth</del> get one step closer to your asana goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAKE THE MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teacher offers a variation to a challenging pose, try it. There is no requirement to shoot and score the pose the first try. Feel it out. Maybe grab your blocks and a strap and see how the props can help with the pose. Try not to rely on them too much, particularly in the example of using the wall for inversions &#8211; it&#8217;s very easy to get to a place where your best friend and crutch turns into something you rely on too much and again you can become stuck, or get used to incorrect alignment which can cause injury.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF THE POSE</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-756 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/handstand-preop-with-block-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Is the posture one that opens up the shoulders? Or perhaps it&#8217;s completely focused on the core. In which case, take some time to practice drills that will build strength or open up the body in those areas. If you are even attempting arm balancing you should be warming up your wrists before you bear weight on your hands. Look at what the pose is asking from you and then do some extra homework to make the goal pose that little bit more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yoga-pose-plank-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Progress may happen quickly or slowly but however long it takes, take the time to check in and look at how far you have come. Maybe you are managing a kick up handstand to the wall now, after starting at zero. Perhaps holding plank pose for those extra 10 seconds is alot more doable. This is all progress and looking at how far you have come gives you a good indication of how far you have to go and makes the end goal way more realistic. </p>
<ul>
<li>CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanumanasana (full splits) for example takes time. You need open hip flexors and hamstrings and quite often these areas are a tight spot for many people, especially if you are an athlete. As the body gradually opens the more you practice, take a moment to celebrate every time you get closer and closer to the full posture. Celebrate and take joy in every miracle millimetre. It&#8217;s a good reminder that it&#8217;s the journey that matters not the destination.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>This is a place where I can share with you my passion for yoga and hopefully inspire and motivate you to join me on the mat. I know many people who are intimidated by yoga’s image and put off that they might not be fit enough or ‘bendy’ enough. Then they hear their first Sanskrit word and that’s it &#8211; ‘Savasa… what now?’.</p>
<p>Well don’t be intimidated, yoga is awesome and just because you might have seen pictures of people in the splits or with their legs around their head it’s not all about that. With only my fingers crossed, I hope I can dispel some of these thoughts and convince you that yoga is something you would like to give a go. <img class="alignright wp-image-39 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flex-square-300x300.jpg" alt="dancers pose yoga selfie sidayoga iPhone alignment victoria" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flex-square-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flex-square-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flex-square-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/flex-square.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To be perfectly honest I am not the most spiritual person in the world. I struggle to get my head around yoga philosophy despite picking up countless books trying to understand it. I am also a sucker for a nice glass of wine, which isn’t exactly in line with a yogi diet, and I have never really been a believer in depriving myself of things I like or want (just take a look at my shoe collection). We are only human after all and life is too short to pass up delicious things. I guess that’s what makes this blog a little different. I will be spending the coming weeks and months (and hopefully years) posting updates, pictures, tips and videos all with the aim of showing you yoga is for everyone.</p>
<p>Remember, be a warrior, not a worrier. Namaste Vic xxo</p>
