								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg" alt="green meadow, inner peace" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

That&#8217;s hard earned pennies back in the pocket.<br />
Or is it?</p>
<p>Admittedly this post is based on my experience and own research, but from what I know and have learnt there is a big difference between yoga classes in a gym and classes at a designated studio. </p>
<p><strong><em>Focus in a gym is to keep fit and stretch</em></strong></p>
<p>As most of you studio yogis know, there is more to yoga than the physical focus. In a gym class people want to feel like they have worked hard whether that&#8217;s through sweating or stretching every muscle they possibly can. I have found that most classes I have attended in a gym tend to fit into the &#8216;power yoga&#8217; category or they are very much a stretching session. Both are great but they only touch the surface of what yoga is actually about and studio classes offer the opportunity to explore the more spiritual and mindful side to your practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/workout-gym-stretch-core-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>A well varied studio schedule will have dedicated pranayama classes as well as restorative options to balance the yin and yang of your yoga experience. While this isn&#8217;t for everyone, I can say that my mindful yoga journey quite often outweighs the benefits of my physical journey. </p>
<p><em><strong>Gym yoga classes tend to be more informal </strong></em></p>
<p>Yoga classes in a gym will rarely use sanskrit. As a teacher, I always use sanskrit as well as the &#8216;english&#8217; name of the poses regardless of where I am teaching purely out of habit but my students in the gym often laugh at my use of &#8216;funny&#8217; words to explain what pose we are currently practising. It&#8217;s not something that strikes me as that important but as a student if I know the name of the pose and I hear the incorrect name even in English it does make me sometimes question the authenticity of the teacher I am learning from. Whether this matters in a gym class and to the ordinary student just wanting a stretch I don&#8217;t know, but in my experience, a good yoga teacher should at least know what Warrior pose is!</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-339 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust-300x237.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="237" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust-300x237.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust-800x633.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-butterfly-badha-konasana-adjust.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There is also less focus on proper alignment in a gym class. This does frustrate me as I was taught that in order to practise safely you need to have a good knowledge of alignment principles, particularly if you are attending classes regularly. Again, this is something I do teach whether in a gym or a studio purely on the basis to help others avoid injury. I like to adjust as this is how I was taught, but a hands-on approach tends not to happen in a gym and is more a &#8216;follow the teacher&#8217; situation. Of course this is absolutely fine, but having experienced hands on adjustment as a student myself, I know I prefer to have that little extra help and guidance I sometimes can&#8217;t find by myself.</p>
<p>There is also no requirement to arrive early for a class in the gym. If people arrive late it&#8217;s ok, and there is no need for pre meditation or relaxation before a class starts. I have even had students have their phones go off which is something that doesn&#8217;t really happen in a studio. There are usually strict rules about leaving phones in lockers and switched off and I have even been in classes where they lock the door as soon as class starts not allowing anyone to enter to disturb others once the class begins. This was in a studio in China as I think a few people would have fire safety concerns if that happened in this country.</p>
<p><em><strong>The atmosphere is different</strong></em></p>
<p>As soon as you walk into a yoga studio I give it 30 seconds before you find a buddha statue, an &#8216;ohm&#8217; sign or the smell of incense, or of course all three. There is a sense you are in a place not quite ordinary anymore. </p>
<p>More often than not, in a studio you are asked to leave your shoes at the entrance and people talk quietly respecting others&#8217; need for quiet meditation before practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gym-sida-yoga-studio-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>In a gym, this is definitely not the case. Life is &#8216;normal&#8217; so to speak and the smell is usually of sweat and sound of people pounding the running machines and the ellipticals &#8211; definitely less &#8216;zen&#8217; but then it&#8217;s a gym and people are there for more reasons than yoga. I love that sense of calm you get before a class begins and have been known to turn up to class even half an hour early (yes I&#8217;m that student!), especially if I am joining a hot yoga or Bikram class. I use the time to open up my shoulders and whatever area happens to be tight that day finishing with some &#8216;me&#8217; time. Everything feels quiet and at peace, a feeling that is very hard to cultivate these days.</p>
<p>The air conditioning is usually on quite high in a gym especially the fancier, bigger chains. Yoga studios tend to be warmer and if you are practising Bikram the temperature is even HOT. This helps relax the muscles to access deeper stretches and for my own personal preference I love a warmer environment when I practise but I can&#8217;t deny to occasionally turning on the Dyson fan during a challenging power yoga session. It is hard to get the temperature right for classes in a gym. Compared to that of a studio, people only practise yoga whereas you may have a yoga class in a gym that is immediately followed by Spinning and you need to feel as cool as possible if you ever decide to try that.</p>
<p><em><strong>Class Length and Type</strong></em></p>
<p>Gym classes usually take place first thing in the morning before the working day and again around 4pm for those finishing a day at the office. They are at &#8216;peak&#8217; times unless you are really lucky and are members of a gym where classes are non-stop throughout the day. </p>
<p>The classes take place one after the other with no time before or after like an &#8216;in and out&#8217; system. They are usually 45 minutes long or an hour and very rarely longer than that. A yoga studio class is anything from an hour to 90 minutes, sometimes even 2 hours with Mysore being even longer.</p>
<p>In a gym, class type is quite limited. It is either a power yoga class with a core focus or a flexibility style class with a stretch focus. There are so many more styles of yoga than that. By joining a yoga studio you have access to so many more styles and while some types of yoga do overlap in terms of style they each have their own distinct methods and way of learning.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, I was fortunate to have an unlimited membership at My Soul Yoga Studio and it opened my eyes to how many different classes were available. My beautiful studio was open at least 14 hours daily and still didn&#8217;t cover all the styles that exist. As a passionate yogini I was in my element and my experience there opened my eyes to so much yoga. My membership allowed me to try as many different styles as I physically could and which classes I loved and which were not quite suited to me and ultimately led me on a path to the teacher training. Happy days <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I began my journey thinking it was all about getting a nice stretch with the occasional contortionist challenge, but realise it is so much more than that and even if I had 100 lifetimes I still wouldn&#8217;t be able to master all I wanted to. It is a very humbling concept and I actually quite like that even though I am a teacher and love sharing what I know about yoga, I will still always be a student on a constant path of learning and self discovery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Props and equipment </strong></em></p>
<p>In a studio, you will be spoilt for choice for props. You want 4 blocks, 2 straps and a bolster? No problem, help yourself. You know how tight your body is and what you need in your practice on any given day so you &#8216;prop up&#8217; accordingly. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-381" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy-800x450.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/office-yoga-kit-copy.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In a gym props aren&#8217;t really available and if they are people do not know how to use them. There isn&#8217;t really a need for bolsters as classes are not usually restorative. If the gym is well equipped there will be straps and maybe even some blocks but this doesn&#8217;t happen very often. Just bear in mind if you do like using props in your practice, then it may be worth investing in your own if you are joining a gym yoga class but see what your gym has before you part with your hard earned cash.</p>
<p>Another issue that has come up during my gym yoga classes is that of mats. As a teacher, I am very particular about the mat I practise on and so usually use my own. Like anything, equipment gets used ALOT and it goes without saying it is always better to have your own mat. There is loads of information online about choosing a mat and you can spend as little or as much as you like. We would all like to think mats get cleaned regularly but not only yogis are using mats. The mats are for everyone &#8211; even those lifting weights wearing their not-so-clean trainers.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean to say studio mats are any better. Regardless of where you are practising, mats wear out and often have been used by many people. If you don&#8217;t fancy investing in a mat I would recommend buying a decent yoga towel to put on top of your mat. That way, when the teacher guides you into a Child&#8217;s Pose you don&#8217;t need to hold your breath when your face is so close to the mat. </p>
<p><strong><em>Improving your level</em></strong></p>
<p>A yoga studio schedule will have a number of different styles but there will also be a guide about the level a class is pitched at whether it be Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced or suitable for all levels. There will be modifications for any class you try but it is quite nice to be able to choose what level you want to practise at and whether you want to be challenged. In my old studio there were even some classes where you had to ask permission from the instructor to join and he/she would decide whether you were ready to join a higher level class.</p>
<p>If you attend a studio class regularly, you are likely to progress more as your teacher will get to know you and your abilities and help you improve your practice and as a result, your level. </p>
<p>Gym yoga classes will be suitable for all levels unless they stipulate otherwise. They have to be because they are catering for everyone &#8211; all ages, different levels of fitness and flexibility. I have sometimes found I need to up the ante for a deeper stretch as I know what my body needs but I am lucky as I know what options are available in any given pose. In a mixed level class some will be challenged and unsure how to use props to help them with their progression, and those more flexible but &#8216;stuck&#8217; on a pose because a deeper option hasn&#8217;t been made available and again stuck at the same level unable to progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Savasana</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-382" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana-800x534.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/group-yoga-class-woman-savasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Savasana is the most important pose in any practice, but is often missed out in a gym class, partly because time is so short or most people attending the class are also checked in for the next one so the last thing they want to do is completely relax.</p>
<p>In a studio you can expect your Savasana to be anything from 5-15 minutes and often ending with the class chanting Ohm or maybe there is some sort of singing bowl action. This truly is a wonderful way to end your practice and one I personally prefer. It helps seal in the benefits and bring you back to the present in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>Many people do not understand Savasana and it&#8217;s importance. During my gym sessions people often get up and leave early which I get as there are people to see and places to go, but it does disturb others and something I would not encourage particularly if I was teaching in a studio.</p>
<p><em><strong>So which is best?</strong></em></p>
<p>To be honest, &#8216;best&#8217; is probably a bad way to phrase it and of course it depends on personal choice. If there isn&#8217;t much yoga in your area, gym classes provide a wonderful opportunity to experience an introductory avenue into yoga and whether it is something you want to explore further.</p>
<p>While I am reluctant to talk about &#8216;authenticity&#8217; as it potentially sounds like I am implying one option is not, it is true to say that your experience in a studio feels more so. </p>
<p>As for what is better that is purely down to you. Many find the spiritual atmosphere of a studio intimidating and off putting while others feel a gym class is more focused on burning calories than the actual yoga journey. </p>
<p>At the end of the day if you have joined a gym and your classes are free try it out and enjoy as you have nothing to lose, but don&#8217;t close yourself off from experiencing yoga in a studio as it is very different. Broaden your horizons and get as much variety in your yoga as you possibly can &#8211; your mind and body will thank you for it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently got asked by a good friend of mine in America what he should wear to a yoga class and what to buy to take with him. After a good hour of chatting online, I realised this would actually be a useful blog post for anyone starting their yoga journey.</p>
<p>For some people, their first yoga class can be incredibly daunting. The fear that everyone there will be far more advanced, balancing on every part of their body <em>except</em> their feet. It&#8217;s also common to feel intimidated by all the poses and wishing you had looked up what the word &#8216;asana&#8217; meant. Then on top of all that, wondering what on earth to wear and what you need to bring to a class.</p>
<p>Well first, don&#8217;t worry. I appreciate that&#8217;s easier said than done but there really is no need to stress out before you attend your first session. We have all been there. I remember my first class in Shanghai and being surrounded by the tiniest most flexible bodies I had ever seen. Everyone was meditating and I didn&#8217;t know whether I was supposed to join in or not, so I grabbed a mat and went to the back of the room hoping I could hide away in the small, 360 degree mirrored room. Fat chance, but being at the back in the corner at least made me feel better. I am now the exact opposite!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-146" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-300x212.jpg" alt="silence quiet notice etiquette" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-300x212.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-800x566.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-1200x848.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Back then, I knew nothing of etiquette or what to bring. There was a notice on the door saying &#8216;Silence! No entry once class starts&#8217;, but that was my only introduction. I supposed it didn&#8217;t help that I was in a Chinese studio where English was pretty scarce, but I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I did learn pretty quickly that my old sweat pants and Abercrombie and Fitch T-shirt were not appropriate attire for a hot yoga class and bringing in a teacup of water was absolutely pointless.</p>
<p>So, you have made the mental decision to try a yoga class. Good for you! You have checked out the timetable at your local studio, you&#8217;ve made the phone call or sent an email and booked yourself in. Awesome.</p>
<p>Right&#8230;&#8230;what now?</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, it is worth doing a little bit of research on the different styles of yoga and the ones that are available at your local studio. Yoga studios and teachers usually have explanations of all the classes they offer on their websites. </p>
<p>Back to when I first started looking for a class, I knew I wanted to try hot yoga as I loved the idea of being able to stretch a little deeper than I could in a regular class, and I definitely wanted a faster paced class so for me Vinyasa yoga was a natural choice. I then tried every session going and discovered there were many styles I loved and some that didn&#8217;t quite work for me. </p>
<p><strong>What to wear</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you need is to be comfortable. You will be stretching a lot in class, so wear clothing that allows for that. For women, a decent sports bra and tight fitting top is a good idea if you practise inversions. In my opinion the <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/lingerie/bras/sports-bras-n-byrt4">sports bras</a> at Marks and Spencer are just brilliant because rather than small, medium and large they do actual bra sizes which I find are a far better fit. I once made the mistake of wearing a baggy T-shirt to class and my first attempt at a headstand meant the entire class got an eyeful. Needless to say, I did not make that error again. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-139" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-1200x182.jpg" alt="yoga clothing comfortable stretch" width="800" height="121" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-800x121.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-300x46.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>If you feel a little self conscious wearing tight clothing then you can always tuck your top in to your yoga pants, but it is worth being aware if you ever go upside down in a class. </p>
<p>For guys, as long as you are comfortable and can stretch anything goes really. Most guys tend to wear shorts and a T-shirt but a lot of this comes down to personal preference. </p>
<p>There are times you can find yourself in an environment that feels like a yoga fashion show stocking the entire back catalogue of  Lululemon. I never really understood that. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a penchant for mad print leggings and I am rapidly becoming obsessed with yoga toe socks but that&#8217;s mainly because I spend a lot of time in my yoga gear and wanted to cheer up that part of my wardrobe. The reality is you need to feel comfortable in what you wear and make sure you can stretch.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is worth buying Dri Fit, Climacool, or similar quick-drying clothing. The faster paced classes and hot yoga will make you perspire and that doesn&#8217;t feel particularly nice during the winding down section of your class and when resting in Corpse pose or Savasana if you have what is essentially a sopping wet T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Just before class</strong></p>
<p>You should come to class on an empty stomach leaving at least 90 minutes to 2 hours since you last ate. If you come to class just after eating a meal, the energy that is needed for digestion is redirected to the muscles and the body is unable to digest food properly. It can also feel uncomfortable. During my training, many of the girls used to pop down to the local noodle shop and have the biggest bowl of carbs you have ever seen. By mid afternoon they were all bloated, sleepy and unable to focus on practice. They quickly learnt the hard way that maybe a big portion of noodles before yoga wasn&#8217;t the best idea. If you follow the 90 minute / 2 hour rule, energy will be focused on the poses and you will maximise the benefits of your practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-141" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-300x200.jpg" alt="waiting early class group sit relax" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early.jpg 525w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Another tip is to make sure you get to the studio in plenty of time. The usual etiquette is to arrive 10-15 minutes before class starts. I usually use this time to relax and focus on my breathing or do a few exercises to open up my shoulders. Other people wait in a comfortable sitting position and meditate. I am not usually one for heavy etiquette rules but I do think arriving early is important. If you are running late and you are still allowed in the class (some classes do not allow you entry once class has started), make sure you enter the room as quietly as possible. Yoga requires a lot of concentration and focus and it can be really distracting if there are late arrivals.</p>
<p>Finally, switch off your phone. Your yoga practice is &#8216;you&#8217; time and for an hour or however long the duration of your class everything else can wait. It is also the most annoying thing in the world hearing a phone beep or vibrate. Think about others and just have a bit of respect. It&#8217;s zen time and all that jazz.</p>
<p><strong>What to  bring</strong></p>
<p>Most yoga studios will have the essentials you need for a class. It is worth checking out beforehand if the studio or teacher provide mats. If mats are not available, you may need to bring your own mat or sometimes you can rent them for a small fee. </p>
<p>I am a bit of a hygiene freak and I have attended some classes where the mats available are pretty grotty. One studio I went to insisted they cleaned their mats but they never did &#8211; and this was a place that offered hot yoga! Pretty grim. </p>
<p>To protect yourself from this, you can purchase a yoga towel to go on top of your mat. There is a fab selection on Amazon and places like Target and all the popular yoga brands sell them. The first one I bought was really cheap because I just wanted something to go over the mats I was using at the studio, but just like anything you can spend a little or a lot. If you fancy yourself as a dab hand with a needle, you can always sew small pieces of elastic at the corners of the towel so you can loop them over the corners of the mat so in class the towel won&#8217;t move too much when you are moving through the poses.</p>
<p>A smaller second towel is worth taking with you. Depending on the class you can get rather sweaty, so I like to take an additional towel where I can mop my brow. For slower classes, like restorative or yin yoga you probably won&#8217;t need a second towel but I like to take one anyway.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water.jpg" alt="mat sports bra towel water bottle" width="1200" height="212" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water-800x141.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water-300x53.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>If you want to go the whole hog and buy your own mat, again yoga mats can be as cheap or as expensive as you can imagine. Like most things you do get what you pay for, but for a beginner I wouldn&#8217;t recommend spending a fortune. You want something reasonable but at the same time unless you are going to commit to practising regularly it really isn&#8217;t worth spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>Purchasing a mat requires a blog post in its own right which I will do at some point, but for now there are just a few tips I would mention if you do decide to buy your own mat. It is a very personal choice. I always look for mats that are non slip because I tend to sweat a lot and I also have a yoga mat for when I am travelling that won&#8217;t take up too much space in my suitcase. After all, I need that space for shoes!</p>
<p>If you have any discomfort in your knees buy a slightly thicker mat. You can also fold your mat to provide extra padding for your knees and sometimes studios have blankets you can use.</p>
<p>If you use props in your class then more often than not they will be provided. I always like to use a block and a strap as they facilitate alignment and allow you to open up in many of the poses, but the studio should have these available. If you later want to develop your practice in your own time you can buy blocks and straps for a really reasonable price.</p>

At the end of a class, students will be guided by the teacher into Savasana or Corpse pose. Savasana is the most important part to any practice and is a chance for your body to wind down after all that stretching, but you can get a tad chilly. Sometimes there are blankets at the studio but I always take a sweater with me and sometimes a pair of socks. You want to be able to rest in this pose, calm the mind and relax. You don&#8217;t want to be thinking the entire time &#8216;brrrrrrrrrrrr&#8217;.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you take a bottle or flask of water with you. Some yoga teachers are not keen on you drinking during a class but I always like to have fluids with me and stay hydrated. I used to get terrible headaches from dehydration because I never drank enough water before class. This is so important and common sense really but very easy to get wrong. </p>
<p><strong>Checklist</strong></p>
<p>To summarise and save you reading through this post all over again, here is my checklist for what tends to go in my yoga kit bag. The fact of the matter is, the more classes you try and the more yoga becomes part of your lifestyle you will buy more stuff and probably spend extra cash doing so. I had to buy a massive trunk to keep my kit tidy as my yoga room was starting to look like a warehouse. I own bolsters, EZ sliders (absolutely great for training the core on carpet), blocks, straps, blankets, foam rollers, stretch bands to name a few. I am also hoping that the birthday fairy brings me a Yoga Dharma wheel to add to my ever growing collection.</p>
<p>As you can see, it is easy to get a tad carried away. You may want to add extra items to your kit list as you attend more classes and realise what you need and what you don&#8217;t need, after all its <em>your </em>kit but this is what I usually pack:</p>

<li>Yoga Towel</li>
<li>Smaller towel</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Hoody</li>
<li>Socks</li>
<li>Headband (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga strap (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga block (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga bag</li>
<li>Sports bra, top and pants</li>
</ol>
<p>Above everything, enjoy yourselves. Before my first class I was nervous too, but the feeling I had after using muscles I never knew existed and being able to do far more of the poses I ever thought possible was amazing. I felt content, relaxed and deliciously stretched &#8211; a feeling that has stayed with me since my yoga journey began.</p>
