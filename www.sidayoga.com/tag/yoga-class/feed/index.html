								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg" alt="green meadow, inner peace" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>That would be a hard…no. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, I was bed-ridden with the flu. You know you have the flu if you spot a £50 note on the floor and simply don’t have the capacity to even think about picking it up. I spent most of my time in my pyjamas in bed feeling very sorry for myself. My body ached, my throat was coarse and my ears were beyond painful.</p>
<p>Two days into flu-gate and I really didn’t feel like I was getting any better despite the R&amp;R and polishing off the best part of a bottle of Benylin (or maybe it was 3 bottles!).</p>
<p>I was also getting increasingly frustrated that I couldn’t do my daily practice, but in truth even if I had managed to pull on my yoga pants I wouldn’t have gotten very far after that.</p>
<p>I of course cancelled all my classes but was certainly feeling the withdrawal symptoms of a physical personal practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-709 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I finally did start feeling a bit better, I decided to roll out the mat and take it easy. Some restorative Yin and Yoga Nidra is just what the doctor ordered – only it really wasn’t. I wasn’t feeling nearly as bad as I had previously, but my nose was still blocked and my throat still sore, so forget any consistent breathing.</p>
<p>It felt just…..wrong. Being unable to breathe properly just made me feel really disconnected from my practice, and just rubbish.</p>
<p>I could just about manage a half decent Yoga Nidra practice but to be honest I think that was the medication. Sniffling and coughing your way through even the shortest of meditations just doesn’t have the desired effect and can often make you feel worse.</p>
<p>When you are ill you really need to think twice about attending your regular class.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me when I am feeling unwell or if I am injured – stopping. My practice these days is so disciplined, I just cannot turn it off even if my body forces me to do so. Yes I am sick and yes everything hurts but the worst part is not being able to roll out my mat.</p>
<p>Yoga literally means ‘to yoke’ and to ‘unite’, and when we have a physical practice, a Pranayama practice or meditation session, if we cannot unite our breath with our movement and struggle with our inhales and exhales, then we really have an important ingredient missing from the entire process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-713" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Yet still I have students that attend class when they feel under the weather and even have clients who will still keep their private appointment despite coughing and spluttering the moment I arrive. My group classes are particularly physical, so this really is a bad move if you are not feeling 100%.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-715" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1200x955.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1536x1222.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-800x637.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I’ve had sick students dash out of the room to grab tissues and don’t even get me started on the consequences of Nadi Shodhana on a poorly students’ nasal passages !(gross emoji?)</p>
<p>When you cannot breathe you cannot unite your breath with your movement and your practice then isn’t yoga anymore, it is something else, something more forced and strained and well, unpleasant.</p>
<p>Even if you try a restorative class or a meditation class, our bodies feel heavy and achy, and our minds clouded when we are ill, and quite often you can leave a class feeling worse than before which is the exact opposite of what we are aiming for when we practice yoga.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the reality is, you are full of germs. Think of other people in the class, while we all like to spread the love in our practice that doesn’t extend to your lurgy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="338" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-300x85.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-800x225.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
In gym environments with air conditioning or heated yoga studios this is an environment where germs spread and multiply. Your teacher doesn’t want to catch a cold and neither do your fellow students. When you feel a cold coming on, consider others and skip practice. Respect one another.</p>
<p>I once attended a studio where students were politely asked to leave if they were unwell – and I was really grateful for that rule. As I am my own boss I lose income if I am sick so I try to be extra cautious and while I am sure the sick student wasn’t thrilled at being turned away from class, I was pleased that the studio looked out for its members and teachers. After all they also lose money if they have to cancel a class owing to a teacher being ill. Of course it’s not all about money but it’s most definitely a factor here and it can be frustrating if occasional bouts of illness could be avoided if people were a little more considerate.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-721 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg 281w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1126x1200.jpg 1126w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1441x1536.jpg 1441w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-800x853.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" />B.K.S Iyengar recommends a number of asanas to try when experiencing a variety of different ailments and diseases in his book; <em>Light on Yoga.</em> This handy appendix has often been my go-to when I get students come to me with various issues and problems, but these prescribed asanas do not extend to flu or colds.</p>
<p>If we were supposed to practice asana when full of flu I can’t help but feel Iyengar would have included them in his yoga bible.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor by any stretch but when you are ill, this is your body’s way of telling you to rest and you need to focus on getting better rather than pushing yourself into a practice that could do more damage than good and even prolong the time it takes for you to get better. It’s just common sense.</p>
<p>Hydrate by drinking lots of fluids and consult your pharmacist for some good over-the-counter medication before resorting to anti-biotics. I personally swear by lemon, honey and ginger, herbal teas and Echinacea as well as my trusty bottle of Benylin (always read the label). First thing’s first – look after yourself with a lot of rest.</p>
<p>An extra intake of Vitamin C won’t do you any harm either, so make sure you have some good juice in the fridge and perhaps some multi-vitamins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
When you start feeling a bit better, there is nothing stopping you trying some gentle postures in the comfort of your own home. There are some awesome yoga classes <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">available online</a> as well. See how it feels, but be truthful with yourself at the same time. Just because you are rushing to get back to the mat, put yourself first. An advanced practice is about self- awareness and honesty. For me, a good rule of thumb is that the postures should feel good – nothing more complicated than that. If you are wishing time away and just doing it for the sake of doing it because you would feel guilty otherwise then you are wasting your time on the mat and you need to take it down a notch.</p>
<p>Relish in the experience of winding down and give yourself some self-love. Yoga isn’t going anywhere &#8211; so don’t rush the recovery process and in no time at all you will be fighting fit.</p>
<p>In the meantime – Get well soon yogi!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GO YOU! You’ve finally found a yoga class that you love and a teacher you connect with and have gotten into a routine of getting that cute butt on your mat as often as possible.<br />
And then what? Your yoga teacher only goes and buggers off on holiday/yoga retreat/teacher training/insert other here.<br />
How bloody annoying! Now what are you supposed to do? Sit on the sofa, twiddle one’s thumbs and maybe see what’s new on Netflix. Well here’s another idea… Roll out that mat and develop a wonderful self-practice of your own! Not only will you discover a new level of self-discipline but you will also find self-motivation in your home environment which can be challenging at first, but oh so rewarding if you keep at it.</p>
<p>I feel obliged to write this blog post as I myself am one of those yoga teachers. I’m often away from my students as I have another full time job (like most instructors), that often means I have to travel abroad. I am very fortunate though. The venues I teach at are always incredibly supportive, and the teachers that cover my classes are seriously brilliant, but I’m very aware that for some students they stay at home (not practising) keeping a close eye on my social media to check when I’m back in the country ready to teach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Let’s not forget bank holidays and the Christmas break – it’s absolutely glorious to munch on Lebkuchen and wash it down with a mulled wine while watching Harry Potter, but neglecting a consistent practice can leave you stiff, unbalanced, and well, not quite right.</p>
<p>Your practice doesn’t have to stop because your teacher is away or poorly or if it’s Christmas or summer vacation. First of all, classes are usually covered rather than cancelled (unless it’s last minute or a holiday) and it gives you a beautiful opportunity to experience wisdom from another teacher. I personally love variety. I know what I like and what I don’t but I also love the chance to see how a different teacher operates and sequences a class.</p>
<p>BUT many of us are set in our ways and like our routine – especially us Brits. Therefore a missed class can have more of an impact than just a minor inconvenience. We can feel more stressed and bad tempered without our regular yoga fix.<br />
In my own practice, I usually carve out 2 hours a day for asana and meditation, but when I travel for work this is often impossible. Depending on where I am going and what I am doing, I’m lucky to squeeze in a weekly class which of course massively disrupts my chi.</p>
<p>In my opinion, developing your own practice is essential if you attend classes regularly. Most yogis will practise yoga in some form every day. You only have to look to hard core Ashtangis who are so disciplined they practise 6 days a week.<br />
For the average person who just wants to use yoga for an escape once a week this can be an absurd ask. I often give my students homework but know that less than 10% will actually practice at home.<br />
So what do we do about it?<br />
First of all, figure out realistically how much time you can dedicate to your own practice. Maybe it&#8217;s small pockets of time here and there, or maybe when you really think about it, there is a nice gap one day of the week where you can shut the door and devote that time completely to yourself for some yoga.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-630" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <br />
Work and family life can make this really challenging, but be honest with yourself and work out how much time you can carve out for you. Maybe it means waking up a little earlier to squeeze in a short practice, or hitting the hay a bit later if you need something more restorative.<br />
If you need a little pick me up, even a few rounds of Sun Salutations can energise the body enough for the day ahead, so don’t be so hard on yourself if your free time for a yoga practice isn’t as much as you would like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-642 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Once you have planned in some time for a practice, think about what you would like to work on. Maybe you use the time to work on some skills including more advanced asanas you want to eventually achieve. I personally like to spend more time in my own practice focusing on things that I find more challenging and after a good flow working on more advanced asana allows me to monitor my own progress in strength and flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-645" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you need something more structured you can always look at the plethora of classes available online.<br />
Now your thoughts might instantly be directed to YouTube but I would err on the side of caution here. While there are some amazing instructors on YouTube offering some awesome classes, there is also A LOT of rubbish out there. Quite often you have to trawl through a lot of irrelevant and disappointing classes to find the golden nuggets. I have spent hours finding some good classes on YouTube but to be honest, I only really use it for help with something specific and usually that’s a 5-10 minute tutorial that I use in addition not instead of my practice.<br />
The attraction of YouTube is that it’s free. However, it drives me insane when the adverts pop up and like I said, for me finding a class I love is often like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>What is WAY more effective for me personally is on-demand yoga classes that are taught by my favourite teachers. Yoga teachers whose style I like and who are going to make me feel amazing afterwards. I apply the same attitude as I would when picking a regular yoga class – the teacher matters.<br />
Therefore, if your regular teacher is away and unable to teach your regular class, why not see if they offer a class online? On-demand classes are usually the fraction of the cost of a regular yoga class and you can have them on your computer or smartphone whenever you want them.<br />
For my own personal practice this is the way forward for me. I live in a remote part of the country where advanced classes are quite rare and often what I am personally looking for isn’t available and if it is, it’s at a time when I’m unable to make the class or workshop.<br />
Online classes are also perfect if you are busy and work full time. Fitting in a class at home when it suits you is way more time efficient than hop footing it to class when you factor in how long it takes to get to and from the studio. For example, if I’m teaching a single one hour class it can easily take me two hours minimum and that’s not factoring in the time I like to allow myself before class to greet my students and the time after class to answer any questions. It really doesn’t take a mathematician to work out the time benefits of a home practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
This is one of the main reasons I created my <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. As a teacher I want to reach out to as many people as possible sharing the benefits of my style of teaching as well as offer an alternative to those who, for whatever reason, cannot make it to class. As a student who loves a regular home practice, I wanted to produce classes online that I would want to do, that had enough varied content and useful information to encourage stay-at-home yogis to develop a regular practice wherever they may be.</p>
<p>These awesome online courses when taken together with your regular classes at the studio or the gym result in a beautiful well-rounded practice that will reap benefits of a solid, safe and strong practice which will help you to progress not only physically but mentally as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-647 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-300x193.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-1200x772.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol-800x515.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/podcast-awol.jpg 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Another fantastic way to get your yoga fix or even in addition to your regular routine is to find a good yoga podcast. <br />
There are so many incredible teachers who host podcasts full of help and advice on how to deepen your practice, yoga philosophy and even help on how to develop your own practice. When I don&#8217;t have some sci-fi fantasy novel playing on my audible app, I&#8217;m usually listening to a decent yoga podcast. Again, like YouTube some channels I connect with and some I really don&#8217;t, but the beauty of this is that you can expand your knowledge and understanding during your commute or doing daily tasks.</p>
<p>So rather than feel put out if your regular class gets cancelled, check out other options that might work for you. You may just find some online yoga gold, a new community and some awesome new teachers to practice with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My palms are sweaty, my heart is in my throat, my brain isn&#8217;t working and I feel quite sick.<br />
I&#8217;m surrounded by the sound of hundreds of pens scribbling furiously, while I stare blankly at the paper in front of me that only has my name and the date, and I am not entirely sure I&#8217;ve written that correctly.</p>
<p>Question 1 is an essay question and I&#8217;m pretty sure of the subject but can&#8217;t recall any facts to back up my answer despite cramming the night before on this very topic&#8230;yep, I think I am about to throw up.</p>
<p>&#8216;Vic?&#8230;Vic? I made you a cup of tea&#8217;.<br />
THANK GOODNESS for that. It&#8217;s the boyfriend waking me up. It was just a dream &#8211; a nightmare actually, but I remember all too well that dreaded exam time at school and university.</p>
<p>I was a good student and I worked pretty hard but the harsh reality was that my memory was pants. My peers seemed naturally gifted and I felt I was putting in two hours of study for every hour everyone else put in and it just sucked. At the time, it felt like the whole world was on my shoulders and my entire future rested on whether or not I could remember the right law case or correct Trigonometry formula. Don&#8217;t even get me started on essays &#8211; I was rubbish at writing essays.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blog-exam-stress-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />I don&#8217;t think I will ever forget the stress surrounding exams and tests &#8211; even non-academic ones. The evening before my driving test I suddenly had a panic attack forgetting what lane I needed to be in for going straight on a roundabout and before I knew it I had smoked an entire packet of cigarettes in an attempt to calm down (I hadn&#8217;t smoked for years). Needless to say it did not help my stress levels and in fact helped me develop a hoarse cough that took a month to shift.</p>
<p>Oh how I wish I had discovered yoga back then. I can&#8217;t help but feel that had I taken that time out for myself to calm down and relax I would have found exam time so much easier.<br />
The pressure I put on myself to do well and a need to make sure that I didn&#8217;t disappoint anyone around me just brought on a level of anxiety that was just off the scale.<br />
If I was ever advised to take time off I would always be afraid that it meant time away from the books which was vital time wasted where I could be learning another topic.</p>
<p>Of course, now I am older and wiser I realise I went about it all wrong. Breaks are important and while I did pretty well at school and university I can&#8217;t help but feeling that had I taken more time to look after myself I would have done better.<br />
Just as I write this, I am having a small flashback to my uni days in the weeks leading up to my dissertation deadline. I was living in the computer lab wrapped in a sleeping back surviving off salt and vinegar Pringles and bacon sandwiches &#8211; hardly brain food. Such an idiot.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-446" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-1200x728.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1-800x485.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/savasana-corpse-1.jpg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Just like a good Savasana at the end of class gives the body a chance to recover and observe all the sensations of the class, we need to apply this STOP and EVALUATE method to life, particularly when faced with stressful situations like exam time.</p>
<p>It is so important to develop good habits and look after your mind and body &#8211; even more so when you are studying. It will feel like time is short and you just don&#8217;t have time, but time out doing something worthwhile (like yoga) will mean when you return to study you will feel more energised and way less stressed.</p>
<p>This is why I have developed a brand new yoga course designed at combatting stress and increasing focus and attention. As well as making sure you get enough sleep and eat the right foods, trying something like this yoga will help to calm the mind and help the body relax and recharge for the next time you hit the books.</p>
