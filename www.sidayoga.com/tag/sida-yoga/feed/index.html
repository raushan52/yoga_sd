								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg" alt="green meadow, inner peace" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/greenm-meadow-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>That would be a hard…no. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, I was bed-ridden with the flu. You know you have the flu if you spot a £50 note on the floor and simply don’t have the capacity to even think about picking it up. I spent most of my time in my pyjamas in bed feeling very sorry for myself. My body ached, my throat was coarse and my ears were beyond painful.</p>
<p>Two days into flu-gate and I really didn’t feel like I was getting any better despite the R&amp;R and polishing off the best part of a bottle of Benylin (or maybe it was 3 bottles!).</p>
<p>I was also getting increasingly frustrated that I couldn’t do my daily practice, but in truth even if I had managed to pull on my yoga pants I wouldn’t have gotten very far after that.</p>
<p>I of course cancelled all my classes but was certainly feeling the withdrawal symptoms of a physical personal practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-709 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I finally did start feeling a bit better, I decided to roll out the mat and take it easy. Some restorative Yin and Yoga Nidra is just what the doctor ordered – only it really wasn’t. I wasn’t feeling nearly as bad as I had previously, but my nose was still blocked and my throat still sore, so forget any consistent breathing.</p>
<p>It felt just…..wrong. Being unable to breathe properly just made me feel really disconnected from my practice, and just rubbish.</p>
<p>I could just about manage a half decent Yoga Nidra practice but to be honest I think that was the medication. Sniffling and coughing your way through even the shortest of meditations just doesn’t have the desired effect and can often make you feel worse.</p>
<p>When you are ill you really need to think twice about attending your regular class.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me when I am feeling unwell or if I am injured – stopping. My practice these days is so disciplined, I just cannot turn it off even if my body forces me to do so. Yes I am sick and yes everything hurts but the worst part is not being able to roll out my mat.</p>
<p>Yoga literally means ‘to yoke’ and to ‘unite’, and when we have a physical practice, a Pranayama practice or meditation session, if we cannot unite our breath with our movement and struggle with our inhales and exhales, then we really have an important ingredient missing from the entire process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-713" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Yet still I have students that attend class when they feel under the weather and even have clients who will still keep their private appointment despite coughing and spluttering the moment I arrive. My group classes are particularly physical, so this really is a bad move if you are not feeling 100%.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-715" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1200x955.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1536x1222.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-800x637.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I’ve had sick students dash out of the room to grab tissues and don’t even get me started on the consequences of Nadi Shodhana on a poorly students’ nasal passages !(gross emoji?)</p>
<p>When you cannot breathe you cannot unite your breath with your movement and your practice then isn’t yoga anymore, it is something else, something more forced and strained and well, unpleasant.</p>
<p>Even if you try a restorative class or a meditation class, our bodies feel heavy and achy, and our minds clouded when we are ill, and quite often you can leave a class feeling worse than before which is the exact opposite of what we are aiming for when we practice yoga.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the reality is, you are full of germs. Think of other people in the class, while we all like to spread the love in our practice that doesn’t extend to your lurgy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="338" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-300x85.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-800x225.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
In gym environments with air conditioning or heated yoga studios this is an environment where germs spread and multiply. Your teacher doesn’t want to catch a cold and neither do your fellow students. When you feel a cold coming on, consider others and skip practice. Respect one another.</p>
<p>I once attended a studio where students were politely asked to leave if they were unwell – and I was really grateful for that rule. As I am my own boss I lose income if I am sick so I try to be extra cautious and while I am sure the sick student wasn’t thrilled at being turned away from class, I was pleased that the studio looked out for its members and teachers. After all they also lose money if they have to cancel a class owing to a teacher being ill. Of course it’s not all about money but it’s most definitely a factor here and it can be frustrating if occasional bouts of illness could be avoided if people were a little more considerate.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-721 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg 281w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1126x1200.jpg 1126w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1441x1536.jpg 1441w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-800x853.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" />B.K.S Iyengar recommends a number of asanas to try when experiencing a variety of different ailments and diseases in his book; <em>Light on Yoga.</em> This handy appendix has often been my go-to when I get students come to me with various issues and problems, but these prescribed asanas do not extend to flu or colds.</p>
<p>If we were supposed to practice asana when full of flu I can’t help but feel Iyengar would have included them in his yoga bible.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor by any stretch but when you are ill, this is your body’s way of telling you to rest and you need to focus on getting better rather than pushing yourself into a practice that could do more damage than good and even prolong the time it takes for you to get better. It’s just common sense.</p>
<p>Hydrate by drinking lots of fluids and consult your pharmacist for some good over-the-counter medication before resorting to anti-biotics. I personally swear by lemon, honey and ginger, herbal teas and Echinacea as well as my trusty bottle of Benylin (always read the label). First thing’s first – look after yourself with a lot of rest.</p>
<p>An extra intake of Vitamin C won’t do you any harm either, so make sure you have some good juice in the fridge and perhaps some multi-vitamins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
When you start feeling a bit better, there is nothing stopping you trying some gentle postures in the comfort of your own home. There are some awesome yoga classes <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">available online</a> as well. See how it feels, but be truthful with yourself at the same time. Just because you are rushing to get back to the mat, put yourself first. An advanced practice is about self- awareness and honesty. For me, a good rule of thumb is that the postures should feel good – nothing more complicated than that. If you are wishing time away and just doing it for the sake of doing it because you would feel guilty otherwise then you are wasting your time on the mat and you need to take it down a notch.</p>
<p>Relish in the experience of winding down and give yourself some self-love. Yoga isn’t going anywhere &#8211; so don’t rush the recovery process and in no time at all you will be fighting fit.</p>
<p>In the meantime – Get well soon yogi!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s here!!!!! It&#8217;s International Yoga Day!</p>
<p>For most people its the start of summer being the longest day of the year and all, but for those that regularly roll out their mat it&#8217;s a day the yoga community come together and mark the occasion with special classes and events.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-505" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3499-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />This special day has been recognised since 2015 and was first proposed by India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his UN address in September 2014 and is recognised as a way of promoting peace, harmony and of course health all over the world &#8211; kinda cool eh?</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to spend my morning with a couple of regular clients as well as my Friday class at Anytime Fitness in Dorchester. The sun was shining and we spent our time practising Yin Yoga at the wall stretching the entire body &#8211; a beautiful way to celebrate the International Day of Yoga, but also a fabulous way to end the week and get re-energised for the weekend.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-507" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_3505-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />I have then spent the rest of my day luxuriating in my own practice, focusing on opening my shoulders and stretching parts of my body that needed some much-needed TLC. Ending with some Pranayama and you will find me in my best mood&#8230;..ever.</p>
<p>Another wonderful thing about this day is that many awesome yoga brands have discounts. So if you need a new yoga mat or want to update your yogadrobe (so copyrighting that!) then now is the time. Here is my quick rundown of a few of my favourite brands that are currently offering discounts on their sites. But hurry, some of these offers are only valid for this special day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogarebel.com"><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/international-yoga-day-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogarebel.com"><strong>Yoga Rebel</strong></a></p>
<p>Save 25% on all your favourite yoga brands as Yoga Rebel are offering this amazing discount on EVERYTHING &#8211; including their outlet. It&#8217;s a really great opportunity to buy from brands like Alo Yoga where you don&#8217;t risk the customs charges and you can save money on higher priced brands. Just use the code &#8216;YOGADAY25&#8217;. Annoyingly, I am likely to spend a lot of money here  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f615.png" alt="😕" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sweatybetty.com/shop/reversible-high-waisted-7-8-yoga-leggings-SB4560_NightFernPrint.html?cgid=shop&amp;dwvar_SB4560__NightFernPrint_color=nightfernprint&amp;tile=13#prefn1=product-type&amp;prefv1=All+Bottoms&amp;start=13"><strong>Sweaty Betty</strong></a></p>
<p>Sweaty Betty are doing something very different here. You can save 50% for one day only on one of their favourite items but you have to find &#8216;Betty&#8217;&#8230;. I have done the hard work for you and found the item, just click the link above and it will take you to the half priced leggings. But hurry, at that discount the sizes will sell out fast! <strong> </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freespirit.co"><strong>Free Spirit</strong></a></p>
<p>For one day only Free Spirit are offering 20% off using discount code &#8216;YOGADAY20&#8217;. </p>
<p>Free Spirit never do sales, aside from Earth Day and Yoga Day and this is something I really respect in the brand. What&#8217;s wonderful about this company is their ethos &#8211; they are passionate about our planet and use sustainable materials in their clothing. Check out their ECO range online &#8211; leggings made from plastic bottles! There is no downside here! Look fabulous in your new gear and help save our planet &#8211; Mr Attenborough would be proud!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yogamatters.com"><strong>Yogamatters</strong></a></p>
<p>This fabulous online yoga retailer sells absolutely everything you need to get started in your yoga practice. From mats, towels, and bags through to props, clothing and even essential oils and tea! A great place for all your essentials and even a little extra. Today, Yogamatters are offering 20% off all Manduka and Yogamatters products. No code needed, just visit the site above and click on the link and it will take your right to the products on sale!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.liforme.com"><strong>Liforme</strong></a></p>
<p>These mats are like no other. These mats I use for my own personal practice. I love my Manduka mats as their durability is just wonderful, but for anyone working on Alignment or needing a more grippy mat for a practice that consists of a lot of arm balancing and inversions, then this is the mat for you. Personally, given the price I wouldn&#8217;t invest in these mats unless you are serious about your practice or certainly practicing regularly. What sets these mats apart for me is first and foremost the grip, but also these mats are PVC-free and biodegradable. YAY! Today save 10% on Liforme mats using code &#8216;YOGADAY2019&#8217;. What&#8217;s more, Liforme are donating 5% of all sales during the day to charity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oysho.com/gb/oyshosport.html"><strong>Oysho</strong></a></p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a specific discount for Yoga Day but there is a 50% sale on Oysho at the moment. I have to say their leggings are so chic and I love the printed graphics on their sportswear as well. One thing I will say, is in my experience the sizes are a tad &#8216;snug&#8217;. So you may want to consider going up a size or buying two sizes to see what works. </p>
<p><a href="https://thesportsedit.com/pages/sale"><strong>The Sports Edit</strong></a></p>
<p>Finally, not specific to Yoga Day, but The Sports Edit currently have an amazing sale on they activewear. You can save on brands like Adidas, Under Armour and Spiritual Gangster. I have my eye on a few items in this sale&#8230;.it&#8217;s going to be an expensive month&#8230;sigh</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/"><strong>sida yoga</strong></a></p>
<p>As I am plugging all these other brands, I may as well mention myself as well! Today I launched my online shop in honour of International Yoga Day. As I start to grow my product range, we start off with a gorgeous little piece of handmade artwork for your yoga room or studio. Hand-stitched in an interchangeable frame this would make a lovely gift for someone or even yourself  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do today, I hope International Yoga Day is magic and glorious!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>While I have full respect for the naked yogis out there, I don&#8217;t really want my wobbly bits on show when I&#8217;m practising even if it is 100 degrees outside.</p>
<p>My practise these days feels different. Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Rocket and Power yoga are not just a challenge but feel practically impossible. My mat needs a daily clean from my sweat and I&#8217;m chugging through more water than I ever thought possible&#8230;.Ah, it must be Summer.</p>
<p>I love pushing myself in my practice, but with the temperature soaring outside even the simplest vinyasas can feel like Mount Everest. It dawned on me during a recent workshop I ran that my students felt it too. A group normally happy to practise as many arm balances and floating vinyasas that 90 minutes would allow, were fatigued half way through the session. Taking it down a notch was very necessary!</p>
<p>So what does one do? In the UK air conditioning isn&#8217;t really the standard unless you are in a fancy gym, and while my generous boyfriend bought me a Dyson fan, it&#8217;s not the ideal solution. However, there are ways we can change up our practise so we are more comfortable with our yoga practise in the summer months. </p>
<p>Here are my Golden Rules for Summer:</p>
<p><strong>Drink, Drink Drink</strong></p>
<p>A pretty obvious one, but the most important. When we practise in the heat we sweat more which is our body&#8217;s way of cooling us down. In turn, we become dehydrated which means our body loses more water than it takes in. I remember when I was practising Bikram yoga on a regular basis, I would always get severe headaches after class because I wasn&#8217;t drinking enough fluids. </p>
<p>To combat this, I made sure I drank my minimum 3 litres of water a day (yes we hear it all the time), making sure I was drinking before and after a yoga class. </p>
<p>When we are dehydrated our blood volume decreases which means there is less blood to go to the working muscles. You may want to consider taking Electrolytes but avoid high sugar energy drinks that are packed with sugar and empty calories. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-397" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-scaled-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I would even drink coconut water after an especially sweat-inducing class. My headaches disappeared immediately. Coconut water is excellent for dehydration and contains potassium, magnesium, antioxidants and a number of other benefits making it my go-to drink when I exercise. It also tastes a lot nicer than those god awful salty blackcurrant dehydration sachets. Birch water is also a great option, but it is a little harder to get hold of. In the UK I have only ever seen it in Waitrose and Health Food shops.</p>
<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t wait until you are thirsty to rehydrate. Keep a bottle of water with you at all times and try to avoid alcohol (that&#8217;s a tough one) and caffeine. Invest in a Citrus Zinger or something similar to pimp up your water, after all 3 litres a day can get dull quick. Add citrus fruit, cucumber, mint or berries &#8211; really the only limitations are your imagination. </p>
<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>
<p>My first ever yoga class was hardly a fashion parade, more a case for the fashion police, not that that matters but it is funny looking back. Now I am not saying you need to hop down to the nearest sports store and spend a small fortune on figure flattering &#8216;sexy&#8217; yoga gear (although I love a spree in Lululemon myself), but it is important you wear the right clothing. </p>
<p>Needless to say, my thick, bobbled, saggy sweatpants and t-shirt I got free in some random event goody bag did not cut the mustard for what turned out to be a rather sweaty yoga class.</p>
<p>My clothes clung to me, I felt uncomfortable and quite frankly, gross. My cheap/free kit rode up in places where it shouldn&#8217;t and felt kind of heavy the hotter I got. I learnt very quickly that high-performance sportswear made from polyester that draws sweat away from the body was a sensible investment for yoga in the heat. I personally love Nike Dri-Fit, GapFit, Calvin Klein Performance and Adidas Climalite, but of course yoga brands like Lululemon and Alo also have their own range of high performance clothing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-409" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>I also tend to wear a sports bra that I can wear without a tank top over the top &#8211; so something less &#8216;underweary&#8217;. I like to feel supported, and while I don&#8217;t revel in getting my midriff out (was never a fan of crop tops), it&#8217;s nice to have the option I can de-layer if the heat gets too much. </p>
<p>Shorts are also an excellent option <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> One of my male friends practises in his favourite pair of black running shorts and never wears anything else, even in the colder months (!). The main thing is just make sure you are comfortable and save the long-sleeved tops and hoodies until Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down and Listen to Your Body</strong></p>
<p>The main thing here is to use your common sense. Asanas should feel good, you should be able to breathe easily and most of all you should be enjoying yourself. If it starts to feel like you are climbing Mount Fuji, it&#8217;s time to take stock and pay more attention to your body and how you feel during your class.</p>
<p>I teach a lot of Vinyasa yoga, often with a focus on core and strength. This can be even more of a challenge in the summer.</p>
<p>Some of the places I teach actually have air-conditioning, but many do not. The glorious sunshine peering into the windows can be beautiful to practise in, but you sure do feel it if your mat happens to be in the sunlight&#8230;slipping much?</p>
<p>A solution to a power yoga style class in the heat is to take it down a notch. Whether this is changing your Vinyasa from the traditional: Phalakasana (Plank pose), Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward Facing Dog), Ardha Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog), consider this: </p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></b>Bharmanasana (Table Top), Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose), Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose), Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose).</p>
<p>Make sure you stay a little longer in Savasana (Corpse pose) at the end of class to give your body time to recuperate. Well, you don&#8217;t have to ask me twice! Zzzzzzzzz</p>
<p>You could even skip the Vinyasa and take Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose) &#8211; this is an option that is always available to you when the practice gets too much. Anything works as a Vinyasa as long as you link the breath with movement. </p>
<p>The Golden Rule &#8216;Quality over Quantity&#8217; rings true here. Modify and come down to the knees and use props to create space and go easy on yourself. It is much better to lower to a Chaturanga whilst on your knees than just collapse into the shoulders and the wrists through heat exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on Flexibility</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-403 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-scaled-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Use the heat to your advantage! I love a strength-focused practice, but sometimes it is just too darn hot.</p>
<p>On super hot and humid days, consider a practice focused on flexibility or even Yin Yoga. </p>
<p>The heat increases the blood flow into the muscles resulting in more flexibility. Warm muscles mean it is easier to relax in intense stretches thereby increasing your overall flexibility. Add Yin yoga to the mix and that&#8217;s some serious fascia massage happening right there. </p>
<p>June and July could be just the right time to start setting goals to get into those stretchy poses on your checklist. There are tonnes of inspirational journey goals on Instagram which helps with your motivation. This could be just the boost you need to start your Hanumanasana (full splits) journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Practise in the Morning or the Evening</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-400 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-scaled-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The best time to practise in the summer is before 10am and after 3pm. The sun is at it&#8217;s hottest during this time and unless you want a Bikram style practice, it&#8217;s better to avoid an afternoon yoga session.</p>
<p>If you are outside for your practice, make sure you wear sunscreen. This might be a case of teaching your Grandmother to suck eggs here, but it is important. A baseball cap is also a great option for keeping the sun off your face, and you will always find me sporting a pair of sunnies <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p><strong>Try something different</strong></p>
<p>Summer is a great opportunity to try something different. If you live in a city, rooftop yoga at sunrise can be a lovely way to change up your practice, or even beach yoga if you are lucky enough to live close to the sea.</p>
<p>I recently had a go at SUP yoga. I have lived by the sea for many years but never really considered SUP yoga until I found out a friend of mine was teaching a class just down the road from where I lived.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Of course, this is a style of yoga that is very much weather dependant, but it felt great to try something different. The weather was glorious and being on the ocean on a paddle board was so much fun. If I ever got too hot I could dip my toes into the water and cool off &#8211; grand!</p>
<p>Even the simplest of poses turned out to be a humbling experience. Your balance is challenged especially when you take the Drishti out of the equation &#8211; EVERYTHING moves. You have to ground your feet and hands a lot, make sure your alignment is as correct as it can be and above all else use that core! </p>
<p>You may fall in, but it&#8217;s so cool and lovely you may find yourself doing it deliberately!</p>
<p>The key here, is make the most of the summer and turn the heat into a positive element of your practice rather than something that just leaves you feeling hot and bothered.</p>
<p>Follow these simple rules and you will certainly &#8216;Beat the Heat&#8217;, and if all else fails, make sure your freezer is stocked with ice lollies and ice cream &#8211; you deserve it!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga can be really intimidating for some people, then add in the fact that you might burst into tears during a class and it&#8217;s not surprising many people are put off. </p>
<p>I am talking about emotions and yoga. This takes me back to a workshop I attended a few years ago when I was living in Shanghai. During the class I remember a Pranayama (breathing) exercise and I could hear someone in the class sniffling. My first thought was the poor girl was probably struggling with a nasty cold and blocked up nose, but it wasn&#8217;t until the end of the class when we were all chatting did she mention that she had in fact been crying and couldn&#8217;t stop. The yoga workshop itself had actually brought her emotions to the surface and once they were there she couldn&#8217;t stop them. It turned out she had actually recently broken up with her boyfriend and quite openly told us that she hadn&#8217;t really been dealing with it emotionally. That &#8216;Keep Calm and Carry On&#8217; attitude seemed to infiltrate her system and before she knew it she hadn&#8217;t even cried about it &#8211; until now.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-227 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg" alt="emoji, emotions, happy, sad, afraid, prayer, confused" width="1200" height="164" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-800x109.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-300x41.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />This was the first time I had ever seen anyone get &#8216;upset&#8217; during a yoga class and I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t the teeniest bit jealous. You might say I had a touch of &#8216;FOMO&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Fear Of Missing Out&#8217;. I know this sounds bizarre and the very thought of crying in public is not something I would ever want to do in a hurry but I wondered what it would be like to have that level of connection and a part of me felt like I must be doing something wrong if I didn&#8217;t have that in my practice.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t realise was that I did already have that in my practice. While I wasn&#8217;t crying I would sometimes have feelings of anger, frustration, happiness or fear to name just a few. I was still experiencing emotion only they were personal to me. These feelings made total sense to how I was feeling at the time. I am an open person when it comes to discussing anything painful or upsetting but when it comes to other emotions I do tend to have a habit of shutting them out.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-226 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg" alt="supported-balasana-childs--pose-restorative-yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Quite recently, I experienced one of my students getting emotional during one of my Restorative Yoga classes for the very first time. We were in a supported <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> which is a beautiful pose for opening up the lower back and massaging the abdominal organs. It is also a great pose to do to connect to the breath. I had only really seen students get emotional during intense hip openers so for me this was quite new. As a teacher it is very important that the students feel that they are in a supportive environment and not at all embarrassed about anything they might be experiencing. My lovely student was a very open person and wanted to speak to me about it. For her, <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> brought back vivid memories of how she used to lie with her ex husband and understandably this was a very emotional experience for her, particularly when we hold restorative poses for as long as 10-15 minutes sometimes. I was very proud of my student. She felt comfortable enough to share that part of her life with me, but it also showed me how any pose can trigger memories or stir up something inside of us and she was so focused on the class that her emotions came right to the surface.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-230 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg" alt="distractions, tv, facebook, phone" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />When we go to a yoga class we spend that time completely focused on ourselves. No outside distractions of our phones, television, work or social media. If we allow ourselves to become completely devoted to that time on the mat, our awareness is increased and it is possible to feel things we usually ignore. If you look at it another way it has the potential to be free therapy. A path where we can completely feel how we want to feel without any judgement or criticism. </p>
<p>I can understand completely why this might put people off from trying a class. Yoga by its very nature forces you to feel your emotions no matter how hard you push them down and for many people this can be a very unappealing prospect. The UK is very much associated with the phrase &#8216;stiff upper lip&#8217; where great restraint is shown when it comes to expressing your feelings. I also found this to be the case when I was living in China where public emotion was quite rare.</p>
<p>Surely then what presents itself is an opportunity? A chance to have an experience without being directly in control of it. Scary for all those control freaks out there (including myself) but what&#8217;s the worse that can happen? So a few tears might roll out during the third minute of Pigeon pose so what? Your yoga practice is about you being in the here and now and by actively working to release tension this can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>When we come to class no one is feeling exactly the same so we begin our practice from very different positions emotionally speaking. The person to your left may have just had an argument with his girlfriend, the lady to your right may have just lost her cat or the person in front of you may have just won the lottery. Their starting point is different from yours and what will come to the surface will vary from student to student.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-233 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg" alt="yoga, zen, sida yoga, " width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Your mind, body and spirit are united and what happens to one happens to another. A yoga class that is well sequenced and well balanced will push you to your mindful limits and with outside distractions temporarily shelved a release is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>The physical sensations of the asanas will twist and bend anything that is stored up in our bodies &#8211; kind of like wringing out a wet towel. Moving and breathing creates more space allowing the energy to move more freely &#8211; almost like a mindful detox. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a quick process, the key to unlocking your emotions takes time if you are open to doing so. Be curious about what you are feeling during your practice. It can be absolutely fascinating as well as healing. Don&#8217;t be put off about the possibility of shedding a tear or two it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Accept yourself and remember that it is perfectly normal to feel however you feel and there is nothing embarrassing about that. </p>
<p>I have included a few poses here to help with emotional connection, so if the prospect of a busy class doesn&#8217;t quite appeal just yet, you can do these poses in the comfort and privacy of your own home and not be at all worried what may come to the surface. Enjoy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Sun Salutations</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-235" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg" alt="sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Begin by doing a few rounds of <em>Surya Namaskara (sun salutations)</em> to warm up the body.</p>
<p>The forward folds during this short sequence will loosen the hamstrings. Forward folds are linked to letting go of anything negative or stressful you are holding on to &#8211; in particular any feelings of worry or concern. If you are new to sun salutations the diagram to the left shows the different steps. Remember to move while following the breath to get the full benefit of the sequence.</p>
<p>During this warm up, take the time to hold the forward folds for a couple of extra breaths and allow the release of any tightness in the hamstrings &#8211; just let go. </p>
<p><strong>Lizard Pose and Pigeon</strong></p>
<p>Both of these poses are deep stretches for the hips, hamstrings and thighs and help to relax and calm the mind. If you have a knee or hip inflammation you may want to avoid this pose.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-237" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="lizard, pose, sidayoga, yoga, utahan pristhasana" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For<em> Utthan Pristhasana (Lizard Pose)</em> start in Downward Dog, exhale and step the right foot in between the hands making sure that your knee is directly above the ankle. Lower your left knee to the mat. If you have any discomfort in your knee you can either fold your mat to make a more padded surface or use a folded towel or blanket. Move your right foot to the right a few inches and bring your elbows down to the floor inside the right leg on an exhale. If you are having difficulty, place your elbows on a block or remain up on your hands. For a deeper challenge tuck the back toes under and lift the left knee off the floor straightening the leg and extending through the heel. Stay here for 5-10 breaths and then switch sides.</p>
<p>Our hips store emotions such as anger, sadness and frustration and are often tight because we tend to hold on to these feelings. To soften this tightness try softening into the pose. Do not to clench and try to allow yourself to relax and breathe into the sensations. This pose also helps to release tension in the lower back and I have to admit is one of my favourites.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-238" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="pigeon, fold forward, aka raja kapotasana" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For <em>Eka Pada Raja Kapotasana (Pigeon Pose)</em> begin in Downward Dog and lift the right leg and then on an exhale, bring the right knee to the back of your right wrist and place the shin on the front of the mat. How parallel your shin is to the front of your mat will depend on how open your hips are and how deep you want to go.</p>
<p>The further the heel from the groin the more intense the pose. Extend the left leg behind you and lower your hips to the floor. Keep the right foot flexed to protect the knee. Inhale and press your hands to the floor send your tailbone down and the crown of your head up to the ceiling and lift out of the lower back.</p>
<p>To go deeper, exhale and slowly walk your hands forward to a fold as shown in the picture. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable. I have been known to stay here in my Yin practice for at least five minutes but 5-10 breaths is a great starting point. To come out of the pose inhale and slowly walk the hands back to come up, gently lean towards the right hip as you bring the right leg to the front and give your legs a little shake before repeating on the other side. If this pose is too intense, try using a folded blanket or block underneath the hip on the side where the leg is bent as this will add support.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Forward Fold and Double Seated Pigeon/Fire Log Pose</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-240" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg" alt="dandasana, staff pose, yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />After finishing Pigeon Pose on the left side your legs should be out in front of you after you have given them a little shake after the intensity of the deep stretching. Take a moment in <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>to centre yourself. Feel grounded in the sit bones and try not to slump the body. Sit as straight as possible using the core muscles, press the hands into the floor and reach the crown of the head to the ceiling. Hold for a few breaths. This isn&#8217;t a relaxing pose and does take a fair amount of core strength to sit up straight and not slouch.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-241" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="paschimottanasana, seated, forward, fold" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Then, when you are ready, on an inhale raise your arms overhead and on an exhale hinge forward from the hips and take a hold of the big toes. Inhale and lengthen the spine and exhale and fold deeper to wherever is comfortable. This is your <em>Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Fold)</em>. You may grab your shins, ankles or toes or use a strap to help with the lengthening of the spine. This pose is great for the lower back muscles and also stretches the hamstrings. Surrender to any feelings of worry and allow yourself to reap the benefits of this truly wonderful pose. To go deeper and if you are really flexible, you can use a yoga block placed in front of the feet and instead of grabbing the foot you can grab the yoga block, but make sure you maintain the integrity of the pose. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable and when you are ready inhale to come back to <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose).</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-242" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="agnistambhasana, yoga, sida yta, fire log pose" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Next come to Double Seated Pigeon Pose also known as <em>Agnistambhasana (Fire Log Pose)</em>. From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>place your right foot on top of the left knee and move your left foot so it is just below your right knee and keep both feet flexed. This is a deep hip opener and can already feel too much of a challenge. If you are feeling any discomfort just stay with the legs crossed and you can also use a yoga block or folded blanket underneath your hips. Press the fingertips down and inhale to expand the chest then walk the hands coming to a forward fold. Listen to your body and do not go deeper beyond your limit. Stay here for as long as possible and then repeat on the other side with the left foot on top of the right knee and the right foot underneath the left knee.</p>
<p><b>Half Spinal Twist</b></p>
<p>After Fire Log pose take a moment to take the feet to the width of the mat and gently move the knees from side to side much like a wiper blade action. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-243" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg" alt="half, spinal twist, arch, matsyendrasana, sida yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We now come to <em>Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Spinal Twist). </em>Feel free to take your favourite twist here.  Twisting is great for digestion but also brings the focus to the liver. The liver cleans the blood and stores energy but is also linked to emotions of anger. By twisting, this action of wringing out a wet towel also squeezes and massages away anger.</p>
<p>From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>bend your right leg and place the right foot on the floor outside your left knee or thigh. Place the left fingertips on the floor behind you, inhale and reach the left arm up while lengthening the spine. Exhale and bring the left elbow against the outside of your right knee. Inhale and lengthen the spine, exhale and twist turning the abdomen, ribs and chest whilst still keeping the length in the spine. There should be no tension in the shoulders and keep grounding through the sit bones. Remember lengthen on the inhalation, twist deeper on the exhalation. Stay here for 5-10 breaths, release in reverse order, head, shoulders and then abdomen to the front of the space, then repeat on the other side. If you find that your back rounds in this pose, place a blanket underneath your hips. You can also hug the knee rather than placing the elbow on the outside of the knee if the original twist is too intense.</p>
<p>There are of course other poses you can try to help find your emotional connection. You may want to try the Finishing Sequence from the Ashtanga Primary Series. Only attempt this if you are familiar with the sequence or you can try a modified version of each of the poses.</p>
<p>Back bends open the heart and give us energy and courage, while inversions allow us to see the world upside down offering us a different perspective and insight &#8211; a great way to purify the mind and and help calm us when life can be too much sometimes. In my own experience with inversions, I have found them to be extremely overwhelming emotionally. At first I had fear, terrified of falling flat on my face, but then I felt empowered at my ability to balance on a part of my body that was something other than my feet. A great way to build confidence if you just keep practising. Remember, it&#8217;s all about the journey not the destination <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a ballet dancer, I always thought when it came to alignment in yoga I would nail it, no question. I&#8217;d spent years practicing my &#8216;good toes, naughty toes&#8217; and perfecting my posture in class so figured I had it down. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I took my first alignment class in Shanghai did I realise that it was so much more than having decent posture and looking pretty. I felt I was taking yoga to another level once I started to understand my body a bit more and could then attempt postures and &#8216;feel&#8217; the pose rather than just &#8216;doing&#8217; the pose. Something I wish I had understood a little better when practising ballet &#8211; my grand jete certainly would have had more oomph that&#8217;s for sure!</p>
<p>Alignment was also far more challenging than I expected it to be. Classes involved holding poses for a longer period of time in order to feel and connect to the pose on a deeper level. We would use blocks, yoga straps and the wall to help align our bodies, particularly for some of the standing postures and it was eye-opening to discover that up until that point I hadn&#8217;t been opening my body as much as I could or engaging my muscles properly.</p>
<p>So what is alignment? Alignment alone is a collection of instructions for every pose where the body is positioned in a certain way that allows you to then experience the full benefit of the pose while avoiding injury, promoting balance and improving posture and strength. Different yoga styles have their own views on alignment so it can be a rather confusing topic. Every person&#8217;s body is different and therefore so is each person&#8217;s alignment. What can appear as a prescribed list of requirements for a pose will not work for everyone. Therefore, the aim is to guide students into a pose that they can perform to the best of their ability and ultimately reach a solid foundation as well as a deeper understanding of how their body works and whether or not the next stage of a pose is accessible. It&#8217;s all about the journey, not the destination.</p>
<p>For me, this is rather humbling and took me a while to accept. Flicking through thousands of pictures on Instagram getting frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t balance on one hand and press to handstand overnight. As a dancer I was always blessed with flexibility and naturally open hips seem to run in my family, but as any normal person I was annoyed that what I had in flexibility I lacked in core strength. As I started to focus more on alignment and as I discovered during my teacher training through the guidance of two wonderful teachers, I discovered that what was most important in my practice was the actual process. As long as I was paying attention to instructions and focusing on a few core concepts and the purpose of each asana, progression to the next stage was something I could decide for myself and that was a really cool experience for me. A lot like having the stabilisers on your bike taken off for the first time and then being able to go anywhere. Liberating!</p>
<p>When we talk about anatomy and yoga it all seems so obvious. Rather than be put off by this idea of perfection we can relax in the knowledge that what is perfect for one person may not be the same for another. By focusing on developing awareness, alignment becomes something that is far easier to understand and accomplish. </p>
<p>During my training, I was introduced to &#8216;Proprioception&#8217;. This is the body&#8217;s ability to know it&#8217;s position without actually looking. It is the perception of yourself in space and therefore a cognitive process. The proprioceptors in our muscles are sensitive to stretching and help us in yoga to develop our body awareness.  Proprioception can be developed with practice. By taking the time to observe your position when performing a pose and using the breath to synchronise movement, our proprioceptive sensors are activated and this allows the body to balance itself in its environment. These simple techniques allow us to strengthen our body&#8217;s response system and results in better placement, posture and alignment.</p>
<p>Developing your proprioception can sometimes be super hard. I picked up a handy tip during my training which I have since found invaluable for helping my alignment and how my body feels in a particular position. Grab a Sharpie and using a decent ruler, draw a line down the centre of your mat. I know, I know, I too was initially horrified at the idea of defacing my otherwise sparkly Lululemon mat but trust me it will help. That simple line will help you when lining up your heels in standing poses, squaring your hips and placing your hands for Plank or Downward dog and so much more. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-119 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment.jpg" alt="sida yoga professional tools mark mat how to lines block markings correct alignment" width="1200" height="310" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment-800x207.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment-300x78.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Shifting focus on how a pose feels rather than how it looks is the aim of the game. I love using props in my practice as I find they help to open up the body more and support safe alignment. I know many students who get put off using props feeling that they are only for beginners, but this is simply not true. Yoga blocks and straps help to create length and space in the body and allow us to access the correct muscles when verbal guides are not enough.</p>
<p>When I first started my yoga journey, phrases like &#8216;lift your knee caps&#8217;, &#8216;tuck your tailbone&#8217; and &#8216;engage your core&#8217; left me bewildered. I&#8217;m not really one of those people who is too proud to ask a question when I am stuck even if there is a risk I might look a bit stupid, so one day I just asked. I was lucky to have such a wonderful down-to-earth teacher who reassured me I wasn&#8217;t alone in my seemingly simple questions. </p>
<p>I was told to sit in Dandasana with my feet against the wall. I was then told to contract my quadriceps by drawing my thigh muscles up as if I was standing strong in Tadasana. From this simple exercise I could see my knee caps lift and realised it was all about my thigh muscles and I was getting all caught up in what my knees were doing and it was all about engaging my thighs. This is so important in yoga as it helps to protect the knee from hyperextension. Keeping this in mind, standing poses immediately become stronger and more solid and of course safer. </p>
<p>&#8216;Tucking the tailbone&#8217; can be quite misleading. Like our bodies, the position of the pelvis is also different from person to person. Whether the pelvis tilt is anterior, posterior or neutral, the cue to tuck the tailbone just won&#8217;t work for everyone. Instead, by drawing the hips towards one another, the belly in and up and the tailbone down the leg muscles strengthen and the lower back is protected. The pelvis feels balanced and the core is strengthened. </p>
<p>The core and understanding all the muscles attached to it requires a post in its own right, but for now I will attempt to put it in a way that is a little less puzzling. When we engage our core we want to support and stabilise the spine. When done correctly it feels like having something tight like a corset or a belt wrapped around your waist. Pull the muscle around your waist towards the midline to try and get that feeling. Lastly, you want to tighten the pelvic floor muscles up towards your navel. Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from going to the toilet. All our movements are initiated from an engaged core. It can be a weird feeling so a handy tip would be to try this when not exercising. While waiting for the kettle to boil or brushing your teeth, get your body used to this hugged in feeling and then when you get on the mat engaging your core will feel more natural.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other alignment cues you can incorporate into your practice, and while I don&#8217;t expect anyone to remember all of them having some idea of just a few of the principles will make your practice easier and far more effective. Your foundation will be stronger, you will become aligned with gravity, have more energy and use less effort to do poses that currently seem out of reach. </p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-124" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg" alt="monk feet yoga alignment rose petal" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />During a class always think about your feet. We always hear teachers telling us to ground our feet but what that actually means is distribute your weight evenly into all four corners of the feet which are your inner and outer heel, your big toe mound and your pinky toe mound. To get a good feel for what we are aiming for here, stand in Tadasana. Lift all your toes, and then the area on the ball of your foot underneath the big toe feel that area press downwards and back towards your inner heel. Then do the same with the area underneath your pinky toes, pushing downwards and back towards your outer heels. Then allow the rest of the toes to come down to the floor. The point of this is to feel the arches lift and activate the legs. You will notice how much more grounded and stable you are. If you are not grounded, it is very hard to maintain a solid and spacious pose.</p>
<p>The same also applies when placing our hands. Fingers should be spread wide pointing forwards and the pads underneath our knuckles should press firmly into the mat as well as your fingertips. Do not collapse into the heels of your hands as this will put unnecessary strain on your wrists. You want to imagine you are creating a suction pad with your hands which will then help to support the weight you can put on your hands particularly in arm balancing poses.</p>
<p>We are always looking for space in our asanas. We never want to feel bunched up or like areas of our body are collapsing into other parts of our body. We want to be always lengthening from our spine (unless specifically instructed to do otherwise), softening our shoulders to avoid tension and keeping our necks long. As a teacher, the amount of times I see students collapsing in poses like Trikonasana just because they want to touch the floor, forgetting the point of the asana. Use your blocks, that&#8217;s what they are there for to help you find space in a pose.</p>
<p>Lastly, but by no means least focus on the breath. The breath is energetically nourishing the anatomical posture and therefore should be our primary focus. Aligning our breath with our movement allows us to move a little easier through the poses. Our minds become quiet which means our focus increases.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-123" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg" alt="sidayoga yoga buddha body mind spirit" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-800x450.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When practising yoga, all the asanas should work for you in a good way and not cause any pain or discomfort. Make sure to inform your teacher of any injuries and remember a class is not a posture race. Use the verbal cues from your teacher as a guide to reach a deeper connection with a pose and don&#8217;t be afraid to use any props that are available to you. As soon as one stage of a pose becomes easy, understand when your body is ready to move on or go deeper, but take your time. Alignment may appear to be physically focused but the mind&#8217;s role is just as important. Alignment of the body, mind and spirit will mean your practice will become stronger, more steady and ultimately more relaxed. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been meaning to do a first aid course for a while now in part because I have always thought that I would like to be a useful person in a crisis or an accident rather than a bystander observing at the scene before me. However, it was out of necessity I started looking for an appropriate course. My partner is a <a href="http://www.paulreiffer.com">photographer</a> and we work together running workshops throughout the year, as well as finding some seriously remote locations to shoot for his ever expanding portfolio.</p>
<p>Paul, like many of us, is also not great with blood or anything medical. Out of the two of us it just made more sense I get the training rather than him. I think it was also his way of giving me a bit more responsibility on our workshops, that or he didn&#8217;t want to be responsible for the extra 4kg of kit I would have to carry &#8211; more on that later.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, a regular attendee of our workshops is also a scout leader and really knows his stuff when it comes to first aid, hiking, and basic survival and happened to know of someone that could train me and also include the Outdoor Pursuits First Aid course as well as the First Aid at Work. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.developmentexperiences.com">Jay Dodson</a> is absolutely brilliant as a First Aid trainer. His knowledge is extensive and his experience with the outdoors was particularly valuable in helping us appreciate how important it was that we understand the training we were given. Training took place at the <a href="http://www.readinglakehotel.com/default-en.html">Reading Lake Hotel</a> which is a great location for outdoor activities. Sadly, the hotel itself has suffered considerable fire damage, but the outbuildings provide a great location for our course. </p>
<p>So there I was, with a group of scouts and their leaders, armed with my pen and pad ready to absorb anything and everything First Aid related, but this was not school and Jay&#8217;s approach to teaching was a little different to what I had experienced before. </p>
<p>Firstly, he made it fun. Full of energy and a sense of humour, no question was irrelevant and Jay&#8217;s way of engaging his students was one I will definitely try to emulate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-107 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-cpr.jpg" alt="sida yoga first aid training course cpr" width="1200" height="311" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-cpr.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-cpr-800x207.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-cpr-300x78.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />I was quite ashamed at how little I knew. I vaguely remember doing my First Aid badge when I was a Brownie and  being grossed out that I had to stick my fingers down someones throat to check the airway was clear before I give CPR (thankfully we don&#8217;t do that any more as there is a risk you could lose your finger so tilting the head back is now the correct way). Aside from that, I realised at the beginning of the weekend how important it was I learnt everything I could.</p>
<p>CPR is also not as intimidating as I initially thought. I was surprised at how much my own hands hurt from pressing the chest and how quickly you become tired but it was a lot easier than I had built up in my mind. Singing &#8216;Nellie the Elephant&#8217; in your head is the correct timing for compressions which did make me laugh despite the serious subject matter. I even managed to get Jay on video demonstrating this, but I don&#8217;t think he would thank me if I posted it here. </p>
<p>Jay broke everything down and went through the steps a first aider needs to go through before someone more qualified shows up. He also gave us some key words that are helpful when calling the emergency services for help. While I found some of the scenarios we discussed a little alarming, I was comforted by the fact that I would no longer be a passive bystander if I found someone who was ill or injured. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-104 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/first-aid-kit-sida-yoga-300x225.jpg" alt="first aid kit yoga sidayoga course " width="300" height="225" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/first-aid-kit-sida-yoga-300x225.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/first-aid-kit-sida-yoga-800x600.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/first-aid-kit-sida-yoga-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/first-aid-kit-sida-yoga.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We also learnt what should be in our first aid kit. There are so many great kits available to buy with all the contents you need but Jay also included what a scout&#8217;s first aid kit could include in addition to standard kits which I found particularly useful. I am not a scout but a lot of the work we do both for yoga and photography takes place outside and I found myself adding a few extras to my first aid shopping list, such as dehydration sachets and cake. Finally, sugary goodness can be medicine! Jokes aside, its good to have something like this in a bag if you are likely to be in an environment where you might get hypothermia &#8211; who knew? I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The second day mainly took place outside. In my ignorance, I thought that we would be spending most of our time in a classroom and got the email about it while I was in Venice a few days before so I was a tad unprepared. With only my fancy boots, and leather jacket I wasn&#8217;t really kitted out for a day in the mud. Thankfully a trip to the supermarket meant I managed to buy some particularly unattractive trainers and kid&#8217;s reindeer gloves for the bargain price of £6 and managed to borrow the rest from my friend. </p>
<p>It had been raining all week so I wasn&#8217;t hopeful for the good old British weather but it managed to behave for the time we needed it to. Jay started the second day by placing a variety of items on a table and asking us what we would take out for a hike in a remote location. I had seen enough survival programmes to know I would probably be hopeless in this challenge but I found I wasn&#8217;t too incompetent &#8211; the first day training must have sunk in!</p>
<p>When you pick your essentials you also have to think about the weight you are carrying. Yoga has certainly helped me be a stronger person physically but there is only so much I can carry before my muscles start to ache. I am also guilty of overpacking. If I am going away for one week, I usually pack enough clothes for two. This exercise enabled us to really think about what we were putting into our backpacks. By the time we were finished we had around 4kg. It may seem a lot but 2kg of that was extra water. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-outdoor-pursuits-survival.jpg" alt="sida yoga first aid training course outdoor pursuits survival" width="1200" height="398" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-outdoor-pursuits-survival.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-outdoor-pursuits-survival-800x265.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sida-yoga-first-aid-training-course-outdoor-pursuits-survival-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />We then ventured outside and took part in a role-play where each of us took turns playing the &#8216;injured victim&#8217; and the other two people would be the first aiders, with one person filling out a casualty card. The importance of the casualty card is extremely significant if you are in a remote environment. It is worth spending the time to fill the card out thoroughly so you can relay as detailed information as possible to the emergency services. I found this particularly useful as it also served as a memory prompt for the first aider. A role play is of course extremely different to the real thing and it is easy for anyone to forget what they could be doing to help, so for me the cards were great.</p>
<p>I am definitely more confident after my weekend in Reading. I met some really kind people and learnt far more than I ever expected to. You might be wondering why I have chosen to write this as a blog post, I mean what has it got to do with yoga? I guess I felt it was appropriate because I feel everyone should have some knowledge of first aid. As a self employed person I felt even more of a responsibility in arming myself with first aid skills to be as safe as possible. </p>
<p>As long as you are mindful and aware when you practise yoga and never do anything that causes pain you are extremely unlikely to be in a situation where you may need first aid. My point is, if there is someone around who happens to know a little bit about the subject and god forbid you hurt yourself, wouldn&#8217;t you rather they come to your aid while you wait for someone more qualified than a passive bystander? I know I would.</p>
