								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga can be really intimidating for some people, then add in the fact that you might burst into tears during a class and it&#8217;s not surprising many people are put off. </p>
<p>I am talking about emotions and yoga. This takes me back to a workshop I attended a few years ago when I was living in Shanghai. During the class I remember a Pranayama (breathing) exercise and I could hear someone in the class sniffling. My first thought was the poor girl was probably struggling with a nasty cold and blocked up nose, but it wasn&#8217;t until the end of the class when we were all chatting did she mention that she had in fact been crying and couldn&#8217;t stop. The yoga workshop itself had actually brought her emotions to the surface and once they were there she couldn&#8217;t stop them. It turned out she had actually recently broken up with her boyfriend and quite openly told us that she hadn&#8217;t really been dealing with it emotionally. That &#8216;Keep Calm and Carry On&#8217; attitude seemed to infiltrate her system and before she knew it she hadn&#8217;t even cried about it &#8211; until now.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-227 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg" alt="emoji, emotions, happy, sad, afraid, prayer, confused" width="1200" height="164" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-800x109.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-300x41.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />This was the first time I had ever seen anyone get &#8216;upset&#8217; during a yoga class and I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t the teeniest bit jealous. You might say I had a touch of &#8216;FOMO&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Fear Of Missing Out&#8217;. I know this sounds bizarre and the very thought of crying in public is not something I would ever want to do in a hurry but I wondered what it would be like to have that level of connection and a part of me felt like I must be doing something wrong if I didn&#8217;t have that in my practice.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t realise was that I did already have that in my practice. While I wasn&#8217;t crying I would sometimes have feelings of anger, frustration, happiness or fear to name just a few. I was still experiencing emotion only they were personal to me. These feelings made total sense to how I was feeling at the time. I am an open person when it comes to discussing anything painful or upsetting but when it comes to other emotions I do tend to have a habit of shutting them out.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-226 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg" alt="supported-balasana-childs--pose-restorative-yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Quite recently, I experienced one of my students getting emotional during one of my Restorative Yoga classes for the very first time. We were in a supported <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> which is a beautiful pose for opening up the lower back and massaging the abdominal organs. It is also a great pose to do to connect to the breath. I had only really seen students get emotional during intense hip openers so for me this was quite new. As a teacher it is very important that the students feel that they are in a supportive environment and not at all embarrassed about anything they might be experiencing. My lovely student was a very open person and wanted to speak to me about it. For her, <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> brought back vivid memories of how she used to lie with her ex husband and understandably this was a very emotional experience for her, particularly when we hold restorative poses for as long as 10-15 minutes sometimes. I was very proud of my student. She felt comfortable enough to share that part of her life with me, but it also showed me how any pose can trigger memories or stir up something inside of us and she was so focused on the class that her emotions came right to the surface.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-230 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg" alt="distractions, tv, facebook, phone" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />When we go to a yoga class we spend that time completely focused on ourselves. No outside distractions of our phones, television, work or social media. If we allow ourselves to become completely devoted to that time on the mat, our awareness is increased and it is possible to feel things we usually ignore. If you look at it another way it has the potential to be free therapy. A path where we can completely feel how we want to feel without any judgement or criticism. </p>
<p>I can understand completely why this might put people off from trying a class. Yoga by its very nature forces you to feel your emotions no matter how hard you push them down and for many people this can be a very unappealing prospect. The UK is very much associated with the phrase &#8216;stiff upper lip&#8217; where great restraint is shown when it comes to expressing your feelings. I also found this to be the case when I was living in China where public emotion was quite rare.</p>
<p>Surely then what presents itself is an opportunity? A chance to have an experience without being directly in control of it. Scary for all those control freaks out there (including myself) but what&#8217;s the worse that can happen? So a few tears might roll out during the third minute of Pigeon pose so what? Your yoga practice is about you being in the here and now and by actively working to release tension this can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>When we come to class no one is feeling exactly the same so we begin our practice from very different positions emotionally speaking. The person to your left may have just had an argument with his girlfriend, the lady to your right may have just lost her cat or the person in front of you may have just won the lottery. Their starting point is different from yours and what will come to the surface will vary from student to student.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-233 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg" alt="yoga, zen, sida yoga, " width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Your mind, body and spirit are united and what happens to one happens to another. A yoga class that is well sequenced and well balanced will push you to your mindful limits and with outside distractions temporarily shelved a release is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>The physical sensations of the asanas will twist and bend anything that is stored up in our bodies &#8211; kind of like wringing out a wet towel. Moving and breathing creates more space allowing the energy to move more freely &#8211; almost like a mindful detox. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a quick process, the key to unlocking your emotions takes time if you are open to doing so. Be curious about what you are feeling during your practice. It can be absolutely fascinating as well as healing. Don&#8217;t be put off about the possibility of shedding a tear or two it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Accept yourself and remember that it is perfectly normal to feel however you feel and there is nothing embarrassing about that. </p>
<p>I have included a few poses here to help with emotional connection, so if the prospect of a busy class doesn&#8217;t quite appeal just yet, you can do these poses in the comfort and privacy of your own home and not be at all worried what may come to the surface. Enjoy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Sun Salutations</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-235" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg" alt="sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Begin by doing a few rounds of <em>Surya Namaskara (sun salutations)</em> to warm up the body.</p>
<p>The forward folds during this short sequence will loosen the hamstrings. Forward folds are linked to letting go of anything negative or stressful you are holding on to &#8211; in particular any feelings of worry or concern. If you are new to sun salutations the diagram to the left shows the different steps. Remember to move while following the breath to get the full benefit of the sequence.</p>
<p>During this warm up, take the time to hold the forward folds for a couple of extra breaths and allow the release of any tightness in the hamstrings &#8211; just let go. </p>
<p><strong>Lizard Pose and Pigeon</strong></p>
<p>Both of these poses are deep stretches for the hips, hamstrings and thighs and help to relax and calm the mind. If you have a knee or hip inflammation you may want to avoid this pose.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-237" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="lizard, pose, sidayoga, yoga, utahan pristhasana" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For<em> Utthan Pristhasana (Lizard Pose)</em> start in Downward Dog, exhale and step the right foot in between the hands making sure that your knee is directly above the ankle. Lower your left knee to the mat. If you have any discomfort in your knee you can either fold your mat to make a more padded surface or use a folded towel or blanket. Move your right foot to the right a few inches and bring your elbows down to the floor inside the right leg on an exhale. If you are having difficulty, place your elbows on a block or remain up on your hands. For a deeper challenge tuck the back toes under and lift the left knee off the floor straightening the leg and extending through the heel. Stay here for 5-10 breaths and then switch sides.</p>
<p>Our hips store emotions such as anger, sadness and frustration and are often tight because we tend to hold on to these feelings. To soften this tightness try softening into the pose. Do not to clench and try to allow yourself to relax and breathe into the sensations. This pose also helps to release tension in the lower back and I have to admit is one of my favourites.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-238" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="pigeon, fold forward, aka raja kapotasana" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For <em>Eka Pada Raja Kapotasana (Pigeon Pose)</em> begin in Downward Dog and lift the right leg and then on an exhale, bring the right knee to the back of your right wrist and place the shin on the front of the mat. How parallel your shin is to the front of your mat will depend on how open your hips are and how deep you want to go.</p>
<p>The further the heel from the groin the more intense the pose. Extend the left leg behind you and lower your hips to the floor. Keep the right foot flexed to protect the knee. Inhale and press your hands to the floor send your tailbone down and the crown of your head up to the ceiling and lift out of the lower back.</p>
<p>To go deeper, exhale and slowly walk your hands forward to a fold as shown in the picture. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable. I have been known to stay here in my Yin practice for at least five minutes but 5-10 breaths is a great starting point. To come out of the pose inhale and slowly walk the hands back to come up, gently lean towards the right hip as you bring the right leg to the front and give your legs a little shake before repeating on the other side. If this pose is too intense, try using a folded blanket or block underneath the hip on the side where the leg is bent as this will add support.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Forward Fold and Double Seated Pigeon/Fire Log Pose</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-240" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg" alt="dandasana, staff pose, yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />After finishing Pigeon Pose on the left side your legs should be out in front of you after you have given them a little shake after the intensity of the deep stretching. Take a moment in <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>to centre yourself. Feel grounded in the sit bones and try not to slump the body. Sit as straight as possible using the core muscles, press the hands into the floor and reach the crown of the head to the ceiling. Hold for a few breaths. This isn&#8217;t a relaxing pose and does take a fair amount of core strength to sit up straight and not slouch.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-241" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="paschimottanasana, seated, forward, fold" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Then, when you are ready, on an inhale raise your arms overhead and on an exhale hinge forward from the hips and take a hold of the big toes. Inhale and lengthen the spine and exhale and fold deeper to wherever is comfortable. This is your <em>Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Fold)</em>. You may grab your shins, ankles or toes or use a strap to help with the lengthening of the spine. This pose is great for the lower back muscles and also stretches the hamstrings. Surrender to any feelings of worry and allow yourself to reap the benefits of this truly wonderful pose. To go deeper and if you are really flexible, you can use a yoga block placed in front of the feet and instead of grabbing the foot you can grab the yoga block, but make sure you maintain the integrity of the pose. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable and when you are ready inhale to come back to <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose).</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-242" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="agnistambhasana, yoga, sida yta, fire log pose" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Next come to Double Seated Pigeon Pose also known as <em>Agnistambhasana (Fire Log Pose)</em>. From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>place your right foot on top of the left knee and move your left foot so it is just below your right knee and keep both feet flexed. This is a deep hip opener and can already feel too much of a challenge. If you are feeling any discomfort just stay with the legs crossed and you can also use a yoga block or folded blanket underneath your hips. Press the fingertips down and inhale to expand the chest then walk the hands coming to a forward fold. Listen to your body and do not go deeper beyond your limit. Stay here for as long as possible and then repeat on the other side with the left foot on top of the right knee and the right foot underneath the left knee.</p>
<p><b>Half Spinal Twist</b></p>
<p>After Fire Log pose take a moment to take the feet to the width of the mat and gently move the knees from side to side much like a wiper blade action. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-243" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg" alt="half, spinal twist, arch, matsyendrasana, sida yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We now come to <em>Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Spinal Twist). </em>Feel free to take your favourite twist here.  Twisting is great for digestion but also brings the focus to the liver. The liver cleans the blood and stores energy but is also linked to emotions of anger. By twisting, this action of wringing out a wet towel also squeezes and massages away anger.</p>
<p>From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>bend your right leg and place the right foot on the floor outside your left knee or thigh. Place the left fingertips on the floor behind you, inhale and reach the left arm up while lengthening the spine. Exhale and bring the left elbow against the outside of your right knee. Inhale and lengthen the spine, exhale and twist turning the abdomen, ribs and chest whilst still keeping the length in the spine. There should be no tension in the shoulders and keep grounding through the sit bones. Remember lengthen on the inhalation, twist deeper on the exhalation. Stay here for 5-10 breaths, release in reverse order, head, shoulders and then abdomen to the front of the space, then repeat on the other side. If you find that your back rounds in this pose, place a blanket underneath your hips. You can also hug the knee rather than placing the elbow on the outside of the knee if the original twist is too intense.</p>
<p>There are of course other poses you can try to help find your emotional connection. You may want to try the Finishing Sequence from the Ashtanga Primary Series. Only attempt this if you are familiar with the sequence or you can try a modified version of each of the poses.</p>
<p>Back bends open the heart and give us energy and courage, while inversions allow us to see the world upside down offering us a different perspective and insight &#8211; a great way to purify the mind and and help calm us when life can be too much sometimes. In my own experience with inversions, I have found them to be extremely overwhelming emotionally. At first I had fear, terrified of falling flat on my face, but then I felt empowered at my ability to balance on a part of my body that was something other than my feet. A great way to build confidence if you just keep practising. Remember, it&#8217;s all about the journey not the destination <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

A day I never used to pay any real attention to, until I spent three years living in Shanghai (then it&#8217;s practically impossible to avoid it).</p>
<p>This year is the year of the monkey, one of twelve animals that make up the Chinese zodiac. The year in which you were born determines what animal you are. Each animal has a number of personality traits that can be associated with a person&#8217;s character, much like the Western zodiac we are more familiar with. </p>
<p>I always think with star signs and the zodiac it could pretty much say anything and I could probably associate with it. We are all so multi-faceted that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible to split the entire population into twelve groups and say you are a certain kind of person. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s just my opinion though. I know many people who love astrology and connect with the subject on a level I could never hope to understand. I would also be lying if I said I didn&#8217;t read my horoscope when the opportunity presented itself and then do a little victory dance if it turned out I was going to have a spectacular week.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the Chinese festivities. I remember this time of year in China fondly, but I also remember it being absolute chaos. Factories shut down for weeks, which is great for the pollution levels (until the fireworks start) but not so great if you are a western business relying on big orders arriving from China. </p>
<p>As it&#8217;s the biggest festival in the Chinese calendar, it&#8217;s also the longest holiday so public transport is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-35468790">manic</a> in the days leading up to new year, as people rush home to be with their families over the festive period.</p>
<p>Without being too &#8216;bah humbug&#8217; or the Chinese equivalent anyway, the atmosphere is just brilliant. Cities are bathed in red and gold, with Chinese lanterns adorning practically every shop window and doorway. People are happy and excited about spending time with their family. The Chinese people work so hard, it&#8217;s no wonder they look forward to some well-earned time off.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-85" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chinese-lantern-sidayoga-new-year-300x225.jpg" alt="chinese lantern sida yoga new year" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chinese-lantern-sidayoga-new-year-300x225.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chinese-lantern-sidayoga-new-year-800x600.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chinese-lantern-sidayoga-new-year-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chinese-lantern-sidayoga-new-year.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Spring Festival (as it is also known), dates back centuries. It&#8217;s beginnings in mythology stem from the existence of a beast called &#8216;Nian&#8217; that would attack the villagers and their children. After a particularly brutal attack, the villages decided to join together to fight back. They discovered the beast was frightened of the colour red and was sensitive to loud noises. Villagers decorated everywhere with red lanterns and robes, banged drums and threw firecrackers which worked in keeping the monster away. Every year following, villagers would continue the tradition in order to make sure the beast never came back.</p>
<p>Today, the traditions are a little different. On new year&#8217;s eve houses are cleaned top to bottom to get rid of any bad luck and start the new year clear, clean and positive. Families get together for a reunion dinner and the festival continues for the next two weeks until the lantern festival on the fifteenth day.</p>
<p>Fireworks are lit practically every night and no matter what street you happen to find yourself on, firecrackers can be heard for miles. It&#8217;s kinda cool, as long as you don&#8217;t mind your sleep being affected.</p>
<p>People exchange gifts and red envelopes of money for good luck and fortune, buy new clothes and shoes to symbolise a new start, say goodbye to the old and welcome in the new. </p>
<p>To celebrate Chinese New Year and all things monkey-fied, here are a few yoga poses to improve digestion and help calm your body after a few days of indulgence. Enjoy!</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-90 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cat-cow-pose-sida-yoga-300x163.png" alt="cat cow pose sida yoga" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cat-cow-pose-sida-yoga-300x163.png 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cat-cow-pose-sida-yoga-800x435.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cat-cow-pose-sida-yoga-1200x652.png 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cat-cow-pose-sida-yoga.png 1237w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>Cat/Cow pose</strong> </p>
<p>Begin on your hands and knees in Table top pose. Your shoulders should be above your wrists and your hips should be above your knees for the correct alignment. On an inhale, arch your spine by letting your tummy drop to the floor while your hips and chest lift opening your heart looking forward or to the sky. This is Cow pose.</p>
<p>On the exhale round your back and look towards your belly as in the picture. This is Cat pose. Repeat ten times, slowly, at your own pace. This mini sequence massages your internal organs, stretches your spine and is a great exercise to do after you have over-indulged. After you have completed ten rounds, exhale and lower your hips to your heels and bring your forehead down to the mat and relax in Child&#8217;s pose. Stay here for several breaths.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-91 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/half-gas-release-pose-sidayoga-300x137.png" alt="half gas release pose soda yoga" width="300" height="137" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/half-gas-release-pose-sidayoga-300x137.png 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/half-gas-release-pose-sidayoga-800x365.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/half-gas-release-pose-sidayoga-1200x547.png 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/half-gas-release-pose-sidayoga.png 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>Knee to Chest</strong></p>
<p>This pose is also called the wind release pose &#8211; I am sure no further explanation is necessary but it is a great pose for the abdomen and gives your colon a much needed hug. It also helps stretch the back and hips and is a nice relaxing pose for calming the mind. Lie on your back and on an exhale hug your right knee to your chest whilst extending your left leg. </p>
<p>Hold this pose for 30 seconds to a minute, keeping a steady breath and then repeat on the other side. You can also take a spinal twist here which is great for the tummy. Bring your right knee to your chest and with your right arm stretched out to the side at shoulder height, bring your left arm to your right knee and as you exhale bring your right knee to the left side towards the floor. If you can, keep your right shoulder on the floor and you will feel a gentle twist on the right side of your body. If it feels good turn your head to the right and relax in the pose. Repeat on the other side. Twists are great because they eliminate all the nasty toxins in your body. Goodbye indigestion!</p>
<p>Hug both knees to your chest then let your legs go so you are lying on your back where you can chill in Savasana (corpse pose) and let that horrid bloated feeling leave your body. </p>
<p>Niiiiiiice. Now go grab yourself a tonic water or maybe some peppermint tea and look after yourself! Your body is your temple after all!  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
