<p>How do you develop  a consistent yoga practice at home?</p>
<p>We are certainly living in extraordinary times right now. Every single one of us has had to adapt to a new temporary way of life as we try and stay safe during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Many of my students work for the NHS. When I catch myself in a grump, frustrated that I can’t see friends for a cheeky vino or attend a family BBQ, I think of them. Staying home really is a small ask in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my life is pretty well-equipped to deal with self-isolation. I don’t have children so no need to don my teacher’s hat. Working from home for me is normal and my yoga practice is 98% a home practice. I enjoy solitary walks outside and so far I’m enjoying my partner being at home all the time. I do miss my family and friends though. That makes my heart hurt a bit. Thank goodness for Zoom and House Party.</p>
<p>Many have used this time to get those jobs ticked off the ‘to-do’ list, improve their homes, unleash their creativity, learn a musical instrument or even learn a language.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>While I applaud that motivation with as much vivacity as my <a href="https://clapforourcarers.co.uk">8pm applause</a> on Thursdays, I can’t help but feel this is all a bit ‘New Years’ Resolutiony’ for the rest of us.</p>
<p>These are strange times and for many, the days can roll into one, routine can be challenging and #selfisolation goals can make us feel even worse if <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2020/01/to-quit-or-not-to-quit/">we don’t accomplish them</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need some reassurance, and perhaps that reassurance needs to be a little more helpful than ‘you are not alone’. You do not need to conquer the world right now.</p>
<p>Use this time to connect…to yourself.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to start a home yoga practice, or a time you needed it more.</p>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/shop"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>With more online yoga than ever before, you don’t have to look far to find live classes. Every day you can find something from all of your favourite teachers. But even this can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>We have put together a few ways to help you get started with a home practice. Take this opportunity to focus on your well-being, boost your motivation and perhaps find some peace in all this craziness.</p>
<h3><strong>Do Not Disturb</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1043 " src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="279" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg 218w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-873x1200.jpg 873w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-800x1100.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb.jpg 945w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" />Make sure that you create a space for your practice where you will not be disturbed. Treat this time, similar to if you were about to take a long, relaxing soak in the tub.</p>
<p>Even though you are practising in your own home, you need to imagine you are attending your usual class. I think this is where most people struggle with a home practice.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to check your phone and get distracted because the environment isn’t set up for you to get your zen on. Usually everywhere we look in our homes, there is something (or someone) that requires our attention.</p>
<p>As best you can, try and set up a small space of tranquility. This is you time, and you want to be able to create the most authentic yoga space you can.</p>
<h3><strong>Make time</strong></h3>
<p>So many <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/">online schedules</a> are available right now, which makes it alot easier to work into your schedule. Apply the same mindset to <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. Just because it isn&#8217;t live, you still need to consciously set time aside to do it. Pop a slot in the diary and make that extra effort to incorporate the classes into your daily routine.</p>
<p>It is important you approach online classes with the same attitude as an ‘in person’ class. This really works for me and helps keep my motivation.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1047" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1200x803.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-800x535.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you are working from home, it can be all too easy to fall into the same pattern. Working through lunch breaks and pattering away at your keyboard for more hours than you should. You still need to take time out and have the breaks that you would normally when working in an office.</p>
<p>Taking an online class will also help to break up the monotony of the day. At the moment, it can feel like each day rolls into the next. Whether you schedule in a live class or a pre-recorded session, both are fantastic opportunities to create variety to ‘samey’ days.</p>
<p>I like to do my practice a couple of hours after my breakfast, and then after some admin and email checking, I’m ready for something yummy for lunch and then I power through work until dinner. For me, that schedule works really well for my routine and allows me to be motivated throughout the day and be more productive. Make a commitment and then the next time you set a time for your practice it will be even easier to stick to.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove any expectations</strong></h3>
<p>So you didn’t do a full 90 minute class and when you did, your online food delivery arrived and the postman called. The kids need your attention and the office has scheduled a Skype call over lunch. So what? Beating yourself up about it isn’t going to make you feel any better.</p>
<p>Life happens. Distractions happen.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1052 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The intention to show up on your mat and make the time is a massive deal.  Just a few minutes in Child’s Pose (Balasana) or even taking 5 minutes in a seated meditation can be enough to reconnect.</p>
<p>When the day runs away from me and I haven’t done anything, you can usually find me on my mat in a supported Fish pose. I personally hold a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders, so this posture works wonders for me when time is short.</p>
<p>Find a pose that helps you relax and open up the body. There is always tomorrow for a Power Rocket class.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep it simple</strong></h3>
<p>This kind of follows on from the point above.</p>
<p>You don’t need a complicated yoga schedule right now. What would you like to work on to improve your practice?</p>
<p>I have one lovely student who keeps requesting hip openers for virtual classes. Usually, I would be like, sweets come on you gotta mix things up a bit! For now, I refrain from suggesting anything of the sort. That&#8217;s what makes her feel good right now, then who am I to tell her she should be doing backbends. Indulge in something that will help you rock up on your mat &#8211; even if it is hip opener after hip opener. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-938 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg" alt="Pyjama Yoga Online Classes Sida Yoga Evening Relaxation Calm Meditation Namaste StayAtHome" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Perhaps you want to take more time to relax, or maybe you would like to try a new style of yoga.</p>
<p>I’ve recently enjoyed discovering new styles myself thanks to virtual yoga. This is a great time to try something new. However, it is easy to get overwhelmed with choices. Try not to set yourself an impossible to-do list of yoga classes. Hone in on what you want from a practice. For me, I love alignment so Anusara is a good fit. I&#8217;ve always fancied having a go at Rocket yoga, and virtual classes have made these new styles possible to try. </p>
<p>Figure out what you want from your home practice and find the programs to suit your personal goals and requirements. That way, you aren’t just doing a class because you feel you have to. You are literally following the path of self improvement and that will make you feel so much better inside and out.</p>
<h3><strong>Join an online class or find a course</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>Use this opportunity to connect with your favourite teachers. I have been fortunate enough to practise yoga in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, China, USA and more&#8230; I&#8217;ve found wonderful teachers who I always make the effort to see whenever I am in the country. Today I can connect with every single one of them thanks to virtual classes, which is something I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>As I connect more with yogi friends I have met all over the world, I’m finding the virtual support and shares really fantastic.</p>
<p>I’ve actually really enjoyed teaching online and will probably continue some of the classes when the self isolation rules are lifted.</p>
<p>For me it’s been a lovely way to connect with my students and I’ve enjoyed the challenge of finding simpler alignment cues that don’t necessarily need me to be there in person. As a teacher it’s been more physically demanding as well – particularly with the stronger vinyasa classes.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t a substitute for actual interaction with a person. However, the current situation has actually been a really special learning experience. For me, it’s much more efficient to use these times as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than wither and wallow. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>If all else fails, shake your booty</strong></h3>
<figure id="attachment_1059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1059" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1059 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1059" class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<p>So your brand new yoga mat is still in its packaging. Your new #workoutathome yoga pants still have the labels attached. The online yoga course you bought still hasn&#8217;t been used and you are ready to give up.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter. It really doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Put on those fabulous new star print yoga leggings and shake that cute booty while you make a cup of tea. Laugh at yourself.</p>
<p>Ask Alexa to play your favourite track and dance like no one is watching. I promise it will make you feel better.</p>
<p>Yoga isn&#8217;t going anywhere and you don&#8217;t have to conquer the world right now. All you need to do to be a superhero is stay at home. </p>
<p>Peace and love yogis xox</p>
<p> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GO YOU! You’ve finally found a yoga class that you love and a teacher you connect with and have gotten into a routine of getting that cute butt on your mat as often as possible.<br />
And then what? Your yoga teacher only goes and buggers off on holiday/yoga retreat/teacher training/insert other here.<br />
How bloody annoying! Now what are you supposed to do? Sit on the sofa, twiddle one’s thumbs and maybe see what’s new on Netflix. Well here’s another idea… Roll out that mat and develop a wonderful self-practice of your own! Not only will you discover a new level of self-discipline but you will also find self-motivation in your home environment which can be challenging at first, but oh so rewarding if you keep at it.</p>
<p>I feel obliged to write this blog post as I myself am one of those yoga teachers. I’m often away from my students as I have another full time job (like most instructors), that often means I have to travel abroad. I am very fortunate though. The venues I teach at are always incredibly supportive, and the teachers that cover my classes are seriously brilliant, but I’m very aware that for some students they stay at home (not practising) keeping a close eye on my social media to check when I’m back in the country ready to teach.</p>

Let’s not forget bank holidays and the Christmas break – it’s absolutely glorious to munch on Lebkuchen and wash it down with a mulled wine while watching Harry Potter, but neglecting a consistent practice can leave you stiff, unbalanced, and well, not quite right.</p>
<p>Your practice doesn’t have to stop because your teacher is away or poorly or if it’s Christmas or summer vacation. First of all, classes are usually covered rather than cancelled (unless it’s last minute or a holiday) and it gives you a beautiful opportunity to experience wisdom from another teacher. I personally love variety. I know what I like and what I don’t but I also love the chance to see how a different teacher operates and sequences a class.</p>
<p>BUT many of us are set in our ways and like our routine – especially us Brits. Therefore a missed class can have more of an impact than just a minor inconvenience. We can feel more stressed and bad tempered without our regular yoga fix.<br />
In my own practice, I usually carve out 2 hours a day for asana and meditation, but when I travel for work this is often impossible. Depending on where I am going and what I am doing, I’m lucky to squeeze in a weekly class which of course massively disrupts my chi.</p>
<p>In my opinion, developing your own practice is essential if you attend classes regularly. Most yogis will practise yoga in some form every day. You only have to look to hard core Ashtangis who are so disciplined they practise 6 days a week.<br />
For the average person who just wants to use yoga for an escape once a week this can be an absurd ask. I often give my students homework but know that less than 10% will actually practice at home.<br />
So what do we do about it?<br />
First of all, figure out realistically how much time you can dedicate to your own practice. Maybe it&#8217;s small pockets of time here and there, or maybe when you really think about it, there is a nice gap one day of the week where you can shut the door and devote that time completely to yourself for some yoga.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-630" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <br />
Work and family life can make this really challenging, but be honest with yourself and work out how much time you can carve out for you. Maybe it means waking up a little earlier to squeeze in a short practice, or hitting the hay a bit later if you need something more restorative.<br />
If you need a little pick me up, even a few rounds of Sun Salutations can energise the body enough for the day ahead, so don’t be so hard on yourself if your free time for a yoga practice isn’t as much as you would like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-642 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Once you have planned in some time for a practice, think about what you would like to work on. Maybe you use the time to work on some skills including more advanced asanas you want to eventually achieve. I personally like to spend more time in my own practice focusing on things that I find more challenging and after a good flow working on more advanced asana allows me to monitor my own progress in strength and flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-645" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you need something more structured you can always look at the plethora of classes available online.<br />
Now your thoughts might instantly be directed to YouTube but I would err on the side of caution here. While there are some amazing instructors on YouTube offering some awesome classes, there is also A LOT of rubbish out there. Quite often you have to trawl through a lot of irrelevant and disappointing classes to find the golden nuggets. I have spent hours finding some good classes on YouTube but to be honest, I only really use it for help with something specific and usually that’s a 5-10 minute tutorial that I use in addition not instead of my practice.<br />
The attraction of YouTube is that it’s free. However, it drives me insane when the adverts pop up and like I said, for me finding a class I love is often like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>What is WAY more effective for me personally is on-demand yoga classes that are taught by my favourite teachers. Yoga teachers whose style I like and who are going to make me feel amazing afterwards. I apply the same attitude as I would when picking a regular yoga class – the teacher matters.<br />
Therefore, if your regular teacher is away and unable to teach your regular class, why not see if they offer a class online? On-demand classes are usually the fraction of the cost of a regular yoga class and you can have them on your computer or smartphone whenever you want them.<br />
For my own personal practice this is the way forward for me. I live in a remote part of the country where advanced classes are quite rare and often what I am personally looking for isn’t available and if it is, it’s at a time when I’m unable to make the class or workshop.<br />
Online classes are also perfect if you are busy and work full time. Fitting in a class at home when it suits you is way more time efficient than hop footing it to class when you factor in how long it takes to get to and from the studio. For example, if I’m teaching a single one hour class it can easily take me two hours minimum and that’s not factoring in the time I like to allow myself before class to greet my students and the time after class to answer any questions. It really doesn’t take a mathematician to work out the time benefits of a home practice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
This is one of the main reasons I created my <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. As a teacher I want to reach out to as many people as possible sharing the benefits of my style of teaching as well as offer an alternative to those who, for whatever reason, cannot make it to class. As a student who loves a regular home practice, I wanted to produce classes online that I would want to do, that had enough varied content and useful information to encourage stay-at-home yogis to develop a regular practice wherever they may be.</p>
<p>These awesome online courses when taken together with your regular classes at the studio or the gym result in a beautiful well-rounded practice that will reap benefits of a solid, safe and strong practice which will help you to progress not only physically but mentally as well.</p>

<p>Another fantastic way to get your yoga fix or even in addition to your regular routine is to find a good yoga podcast. <br />
There are so many incredible teachers who host podcasts full of help and advice on how to deepen your practice, yoga philosophy and even help on how to develop your own practice. When I don&#8217;t have some sci-fi fantasy novel playing on my audible app, I&#8217;m usually listening to a decent yoga podcast. Again, like YouTube some channels I connect with and some I really don&#8217;t, but the beauty of this is that you can expand your knowledge and understanding during your commute or doing daily tasks.</p>
<p>So rather than feel put out if your regular class gets cancelled, check out other options that might work for you. You may just find some online yoga gold, a new community and some awesome new teachers to practice with.</p>
