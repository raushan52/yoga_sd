								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can often happen with blogs, and has done here, is sometimes there can be large gaps since the previous post. Firstly, I apologise profusely and I promise you I haven&#8217;t been slacking. A mammoth photography trip to New Zealand has kept me rather busy for the last month and therefore a tad rubbish in the blog department. Although I did manage to squeeze in some excellent yoga classes on my trip despite the countless sunrise shoots I had to wake up for. </p>
<p>New Zealand is truly a fantastic place though. My partner <a href="http://www.paulreiffer.com">Paul Reiffer</a> and I were running a photography workshop out there and the extensive opportunities for shooting are simply breathtaking. I feel like I have aged about ten years with the late nights and early starts and was sometimes grumpy with the lack of yoga, but it really is a place that should be on everyone&#8217;s bucket list. If the scenery can&#8217;t convince you (see pictures) then the food and wine has to. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga.jpg" alt="NewZealandblogyoga" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NewZealandblogyoga-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Now for some exciting news. Drum roll please! Next week I begin teaching at the <a href="http://www.dorchesteryoga.co.uk">Dorchester Yoga and Therapy Centre</a>. I am running a 5 week course that will focus on TAV and Restorative Yoga.</p>
<p>TAV is an abbreviated term for Therapeutic Alignment Vinyasa and is one of my favourite styles of yoga to practise and teach because it allows you to explore poses a little deeper than a faster-paced yoga class. The idea is that by focusing on alignment you can connect more to each asana and become more aware of space and your place in it. Your practice becomes easier and a lot stronger.</p>
<p>Restorative yoga is perfect for those who want a break from their hectic schedules and need to take time out for themselves. This style of yoga takes you on a journey of deep relaxation where the focus is on the breath and calming the body and the mind. Only a handful of poses are performed during the sequence as they are each held for an extended period of time &#8211; sometimes up to 10 minutes a pose. While the poses themselves are not physically difficult and can be done without too much muscle strength, the challenge is staying in the present and allowing yourself to relax. Classes can help relieve the nervous system, improve focus and release muscle tension &#8211; basically a spa treatment without the expensive bill at the end. Bonus!</p>
<p>I am really excited about teaching at such a fantastic venue. The Dorchester Yoga and Therapy Centre has such a lovely vibe about it, and the smell of incense as you walk in is like a big hug. The studio is extremely spacious with lots of natural light and there are plenty of mats, bolsters and other yoga props available. There are also some other really great classes on the <a href="http://www.dorchesteryoga.co.uk/timetable/">timetable</a> &#8211; lots of variety so there really is something for everyone.</p>
<p>I am a teacher who likes to plan, and these days you will find me in my office/studio furiously scribbling down sequences and exercises. I like to be prepared. I like to know that a class I have planned is balanced, challenging and has an intention. To be honest that is probably the hardest part for me. I know in my own practice and classes I participate in, I like to be pushed beyond my limits and love sequences and exercises that are outside the norm, but not everyone is like that. </p>
<p>Everyone has a different idea about what they want to get out of a class. When I first started going to yoga classes my intention was to improve my flexibility so I could kick ass in my dance classes. Now, I find myself not giving too hoots about that and focused more on facing head on the poses I once feared. That for me is what&#8217;s so exciting about yoga. There is always an extra step you can take and the learning is constant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga.jpg" alt="groupclassyoga" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/groupclassyoga-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>My 5 week course that starts next Tuesday will focus on a different aspect of Therapeutic Alignment in each class. While I will use more than one alignment cue for every pose, the idea is that by focusing on one aspect per session, by the end of the course students will be well versed in a number of alignment hints and be practising each one as if it were second nature. Thus, improving their own level and ability. You will become more focused, more aware and connected deeper to your practice.</p>
<p>More details and prices are available on the <a href="http://www.sidayoga.com/classes/">class</a> page and also check out my previous blog post if you haven&#8217;t already, about what to bring to a yoga class and how to prepare. </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Come and join me for a fabulous yoga journey! </p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently got asked by a good friend of mine in America what he should wear to a yoga class and what to buy to take with him. After a good hour of chatting online, I realised this would actually be a useful blog post for anyone starting their yoga journey.</p>
<p>For some people, their first yoga class can be incredibly daunting. The fear that everyone there will be far more advanced, balancing on every part of their body <em>except</em> their feet. It&#8217;s also common to feel intimidated by all the poses and wishing you had looked up what the word &#8216;asana&#8217; meant. Then on top of all that, wondering what on earth to wear and what you need to bring to a class.</p>
<p>Well first, don&#8217;t worry. I appreciate that&#8217;s easier said than done but there really is no need to stress out before you attend your first session. We have all been there. I remember my first class in Shanghai and being surrounded by the tiniest most flexible bodies I had ever seen. Everyone was meditating and I didn&#8217;t know whether I was supposed to join in or not, so I grabbed a mat and went to the back of the room hoping I could hide away in the small, 360 degree mirrored room. Fat chance, but being at the back in the corner at least made me feel better. I am now the exact opposite!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-146" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-300x212.jpg" alt="silence quiet notice etiquette" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-300x212.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-800x566.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-1200x848.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Back then, I knew nothing of etiquette or what to bring. There was a notice on the door saying &#8216;Silence! No entry once class starts&#8217;, but that was my only introduction. I supposed it didn&#8217;t help that I was in a Chinese studio where English was pretty scarce, but I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I did learn pretty quickly that my old sweat pants and Abercrombie and Fitch T-shirt were not appropriate attire for a hot yoga class and bringing in a teacup of water was absolutely pointless.</p>
<p>So, you have made the mental decision to try a yoga class. Good for you! You have checked out the timetable at your local studio, you&#8217;ve made the phone call or sent an email and booked yourself in. Awesome.</p>
<p>Right&#8230;&#8230;what now?</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, it is worth doing a little bit of research on the different styles of yoga and the ones that are available at your local studio. Yoga studios and teachers usually have explanations of all the classes they offer on their websites. </p>
<p>Back to when I first started looking for a class, I knew I wanted to try hot yoga as I loved the idea of being able to stretch a little deeper than I could in a regular class, and I definitely wanted a faster paced class so for me Vinyasa yoga was a natural choice. I then tried every session going and discovered there were many styles I loved and some that didn&#8217;t quite work for me. </p>
<p><strong>What to wear</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you need is to be comfortable. You will be stretching a lot in class, so wear clothing that allows for that. For women, a decent sports bra and tight fitting top is a good idea if you practise inversions. In my opinion the <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/lingerie/bras/sports-bras-n-byrt4">sports bras</a> at Marks and Spencer are just brilliant because rather than small, medium and large they do actual bra sizes which I find are a far better fit. I once made the mistake of wearing a baggy T-shirt to class and my first attempt at a headstand meant the entire class got an eyeful. Needless to say, I did not make that error again. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-139" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-1200x182.jpg" alt="yoga clothing comfortable stretch" width="800" height="121" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-800x121.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-300x46.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>If you feel a little self conscious wearing tight clothing then you can always tuck your top in to your yoga pants, but it is worth being aware if you ever go upside down in a class. </p>
<p>For guys, as long as you are comfortable and can stretch anything goes really. Most guys tend to wear shorts and a T-shirt but a lot of this comes down to personal preference. </p>
<p>There are times you can find yourself in an environment that feels like a yoga fashion show stocking the entire back catalogue of  Lululemon. I never really understood that. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a penchant for mad print leggings and I am rapidly becoming obsessed with yoga toe socks but that&#8217;s mainly because I spend a lot of time in my yoga gear and wanted to cheer up that part of my wardrobe. The reality is you need to feel comfortable in what you wear and make sure you can stretch.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is worth buying Dri Fit, Climacool, or similar quick-drying clothing. The faster paced classes and hot yoga will make you perspire and that doesn&#8217;t feel particularly nice during the winding down section of your class and when resting in Corpse pose or Savasana if you have what is essentially a sopping wet T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Just before class</strong></p>
<p>You should come to class on an empty stomach leaving at least 90 minutes to 2 hours since you last ate. If you come to class just after eating a meal, the energy that is needed for digestion is redirected to the muscles and the body is unable to digest food properly. It can also feel uncomfortable. During my training, many of the girls used to pop down to the local noodle shop and have the biggest bowl of carbs you have ever seen. By mid afternoon they were all bloated, sleepy and unable to focus on practice. They quickly learnt the hard way that maybe a big portion of noodles before yoga wasn&#8217;t the best idea. If you follow the 90 minute / 2 hour rule, energy will be focused on the poses and you will maximise the benefits of your practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-141" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-300x200.jpg" alt="waiting early class group sit relax" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early.jpg 525w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Another tip is to make sure you get to the studio in plenty of time. The usual etiquette is to arrive 10-15 minutes before class starts. I usually use this time to relax and focus on my breathing or do a few exercises to open up my shoulders. Other people wait in a comfortable sitting position and meditate. I am not usually one for heavy etiquette rules but I do think arriving early is important. If you are running late and you are still allowed in the class (some classes do not allow you entry once class has started), make sure you enter the room as quietly as possible. Yoga requires a lot of concentration and focus and it can be really distracting if there are late arrivals.</p>
<p>Finally, switch off your phone. Your yoga practice is &#8216;you&#8217; time and for an hour or however long the duration of your class everything else can wait. It is also the most annoying thing in the world hearing a phone beep or vibrate. Think about others and just have a bit of respect. It&#8217;s zen time and all that jazz.</p>
<p><strong>What to  bring</strong></p>
<p>Most yoga studios will have the essentials you need for a class. It is worth checking out beforehand if the studio or teacher provide mats. If mats are not available, you may need to bring your own mat or sometimes you can rent them for a small fee. </p>
<p>I am a bit of a hygiene freak and I have attended some classes where the mats available are pretty grotty. One studio I went to insisted they cleaned their mats but they never did &#8211; and this was a place that offered hot yoga! Pretty grim. </p>
<p>To protect yourself from this, you can purchase a yoga towel to go on top of your mat. There is a fab selection on Amazon and places like Target and all the popular yoga brands sell them. The first one I bought was really cheap because I just wanted something to go over the mats I was using at the studio, but just like anything you can spend a little or a lot. If you fancy yourself as a dab hand with a needle, you can always sew small pieces of elastic at the corners of the towel so you can loop them over the corners of the mat so in class the towel won&#8217;t move too much when you are moving through the poses.</p>
<p>A smaller second towel is worth taking with you. Depending on the class you can get rather sweaty, so I like to take an additional towel where I can mop my brow. For slower classes, like restorative or yin yoga you probably won&#8217;t need a second towel but I like to take one anyway.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water.jpg" alt="mat sports bra towel water bottle" width="1200" height="212" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water-800x141.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water-300x53.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>If you want to go the whole hog and buy your own mat, again yoga mats can be as cheap or as expensive as you can imagine. Like most things you do get what you pay for, but for a beginner I wouldn&#8217;t recommend spending a fortune. You want something reasonable but at the same time unless you are going to commit to practising regularly it really isn&#8217;t worth spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>Purchasing a mat requires a blog post in its own right which I will do at some point, but for now there are just a few tips I would mention if you do decide to buy your own mat. It is a very personal choice. I always look for mats that are non slip because I tend to sweat a lot and I also have a yoga mat for when I am travelling that won&#8217;t take up too much space in my suitcase. After all, I need that space for shoes!</p>
<p>If you have any discomfort in your knees buy a slightly thicker mat. You can also fold your mat to provide extra padding for your knees and sometimes studios have blankets you can use.</p>
<p>If you use props in your class then more often than not they will be provided. I always like to use a block and a strap as they facilitate alignment and allow you to open up in many of the poses, but the studio should have these available. If you later want to develop your practice in your own time you can buy blocks and straps for a really reasonable price.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-145" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-pose-corpse-pose-300x225.jpg" alt="yoga pose savasana corpse sida yoga" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-pose-corpse-pose-300x225.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-pose-corpse-pose.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Also worth adding to your yoga kit bag is a hoody or a sweater. At the end of a class, students will be guided by the teacher into Savasana or Corpse pose. Savasana is the most important part to any practice and is a chance for your body to wind down after all that stretching, but you can get a tad chilly. Sometimes there are blankets at the studio but I always take a sweater with me and sometimes a pair of socks. You want to be able to rest in this pose, calm the mind and relax. You don&#8217;t want to be thinking the entire time &#8216;brrrrrrrrrrrr&#8217;.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you take a bottle or flask of water with you. Some yoga teachers are not keen on you drinking during a class but I always like to have fluids with me and stay hydrated. I used to get terrible headaches from dehydration because I never drank enough water before class. This is so important and common sense really but very easy to get wrong. </p>
<p><strong>Checklist</strong></p>
<p>To summarise and save you reading through this post all over again, here is my checklist for what tends to go in my yoga kit bag. The fact of the matter is, the more classes you try and the more yoga becomes part of your lifestyle you will buy more stuff and probably spend extra cash doing so. I had to buy a massive trunk to keep my kit tidy as my yoga room was starting to look like a warehouse. I own bolsters, EZ sliders (absolutely great for training the core on carpet), blocks, straps, blankets, foam rollers, stretch bands to name a few. I am also hoping that the birthday fairy brings me a Yoga Dharma wheel to add to my ever growing collection.</p>
<p>As you can see, it is easy to get a tad carried away. You may want to add extra items to your kit list as you attend more classes and realise what you need and what you don&#8217;t need, after all its <em>your </em>kit but this is what I usually pack:</p>
<ol>
<li><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-135" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-276x300.jpg" alt="mat towel manduka bag calvin klein pants yoga top sports bra block strap socks hoody headband water" width="276" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-276x300.jpg 276w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-800x869.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-1105x1200.jpg 1105w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2.jpg 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" />Yoga Mat</li>
<li>Yoga Towel</li>
<li>Smaller towel</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Hoody</li>
<li>Socks</li>
<li>Headband (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga strap (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga block (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga bag</li>
<li>Sports bra, top and pants</li>
</ol>
<p>Above everything, enjoy yourselves. Before my first class I was nervous too, but the feeling I had after using muscles I never knew existed and being able to do far more of the poses I ever thought possible was amazing. I felt content, relaxed and deliciously stretched &#8211; a feeling that has stayed with me since my yoga journey began.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a ballet dancer, I always thought when it came to alignment in yoga I would nail it, no question. I&#8217;d spent years practicing my &#8216;good toes, naughty toes&#8217; and perfecting my posture in class so figured I had it down. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I took my first alignment class in Shanghai did I realise that it was so much more than having decent posture and looking pretty. I felt I was taking yoga to another level once I started to understand my body a bit more and could then attempt postures and &#8216;feel&#8217; the pose rather than just &#8216;doing&#8217; the pose. Something I wish I had understood a little better when practising ballet &#8211; my grand jete certainly would have had more oomph that&#8217;s for sure!</p>
<p>Alignment was also far more challenging than I expected it to be. Classes involved holding poses for a longer period of time in order to feel and connect to the pose on a deeper level. We would use blocks, yoga straps and the wall to help align our bodies, particularly for some of the standing postures and it was eye-opening to discover that up until that point I hadn&#8217;t been opening my body as much as I could or engaging my muscles properly.</p>
<p>So what is alignment? Alignment alone is a collection of instructions for every pose where the body is positioned in a certain way that allows you to then experience the full benefit of the pose while avoiding injury, promoting balance and improving posture and strength. Different yoga styles have their own views on alignment so it can be a rather confusing topic. Every person&#8217;s body is different and therefore so is each person&#8217;s alignment. What can appear as a prescribed list of requirements for a pose will not work for everyone. Therefore, the aim is to guide students into a pose that they can perform to the best of their ability and ultimately reach a solid foundation as well as a deeper understanding of how their body works and whether or not the next stage of a pose is accessible. It&#8217;s all about the journey, not the destination.</p>
<p>For me, this is rather humbling and took me a while to accept. Flicking through thousands of pictures on Instagram getting frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t balance on one hand and press to handstand overnight. As a dancer I was always blessed with flexibility and naturally open hips seem to run in my family, but as any normal person I was annoyed that what I had in flexibility I lacked in core strength. As I started to focus more on alignment and as I discovered during my teacher training through the guidance of two wonderful teachers, I discovered that what was most important in my practice was the actual process. As long as I was paying attention to instructions and focusing on a few core concepts and the purpose of each asana, progression to the next stage was something I could decide for myself and that was a really cool experience for me. A lot like having the stabilisers on your bike taken off for the first time and then being able to go anywhere. Liberating!</p>
<p>When we talk about anatomy and yoga it all seems so obvious. Rather than be put off by this idea of perfection we can relax in the knowledge that what is perfect for one person may not be the same for another. By focusing on developing awareness, alignment becomes something that is far easier to understand and accomplish. </p>
<p>During my training, I was introduced to &#8216;Proprioception&#8217;. This is the body&#8217;s ability to know it&#8217;s position without actually looking. It is the perception of yourself in space and therefore a cognitive process. The proprioceptors in our muscles are sensitive to stretching and help us in yoga to develop our body awareness.  Proprioception can be developed with practice. By taking the time to observe your position when performing a pose and using the breath to synchronise movement, our proprioceptive sensors are activated and this allows the body to balance itself in its environment. These simple techniques allow us to strengthen our body&#8217;s response system and results in better placement, posture and alignment.</p>
<p>Developing your proprioception can sometimes be super hard. I picked up a handy tip during my training which I have since found invaluable for helping my alignment and how my body feels in a particular position. Grab a Sharpie and using a decent ruler, draw a line down the centre of your mat. I know, I know, I too was initially horrified at the idea of defacing my otherwise sparkly Lululemon mat but trust me it will help. That simple line will help you when lining up your heels in standing poses, squaring your hips and placing your hands for Plank or Downward dog and so much more. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-119 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment.jpg" alt="sida yoga professional tools mark mat how to lines block markings correct alignment" width="1200" height="310" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment-800x207.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sida-yoga-professional-tools-mark-mat-how-to-lines-markings-correct-alignment-300x78.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Shifting focus on how a pose feels rather than how it looks is the aim of the game. I love using props in my practice as I find they help to open up the body more and support safe alignment. I know many students who get put off using props feeling that they are only for beginners, but this is simply not true. Yoga blocks and straps help to create length and space in the body and allow us to access the correct muscles when verbal guides are not enough.</p>
<p>When I first started my yoga journey, phrases like &#8216;lift your knee caps&#8217;, &#8216;tuck your tailbone&#8217; and &#8216;engage your core&#8217; left me bewildered. I&#8217;m not really one of those people who is too proud to ask a question when I am stuck even if there is a risk I might look a bit stupid, so one day I just asked. I was lucky to have such a wonderful down-to-earth teacher who reassured me I wasn&#8217;t alone in my seemingly simple questions. </p>
<p>I was told to sit in Dandasana with my feet against the wall. I was then told to contract my quadriceps by drawing my thigh muscles up as if I was standing strong in Tadasana. From this simple exercise I could see my knee caps lift and realised it was all about my thigh muscles and I was getting all caught up in what my knees were doing and it was all about engaging my thighs. This is so important in yoga as it helps to protect the knee from hyperextension. Keeping this in mind, standing poses immediately become stronger and more solid and of course safer. </p>
<p>&#8216;Tucking the tailbone&#8217; can be quite misleading. Like our bodies, the position of the pelvis is also different from person to person. Whether the pelvis tilt is anterior, posterior or neutral, the cue to tuck the tailbone just won&#8217;t work for everyone. Instead, by drawing the hips towards one another, the belly in and up and the tailbone down the leg muscles strengthen and the lower back is protected. The pelvis feels balanced and the core is strengthened. </p>
<p>The core and understanding all the muscles attached to it requires a post in its own right, but for now I will attempt to put it in a way that is a little less puzzling. When we engage our core we want to support and stabilise the spine. When done correctly it feels like having something tight like a corset or a belt wrapped around your waist. Pull the muscle around your waist towards the midline to try and get that feeling. Lastly, you want to tighten the pelvic floor muscles up towards your navel. Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from going to the toilet. All our movements are initiated from an engaged core. It can be a weird feeling so a handy tip would be to try this when not exercising. While waiting for the kettle to boil or brushing your teeth, get your body used to this hugged in feeling and then when you get on the mat engaging your core will feel more natural.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other alignment cues you can incorporate into your practice, and while I don&#8217;t expect anyone to remember all of them having some idea of just a few of the principles will make your practice easier and far more effective. Your foundation will be stronger, you will become aligned with gravity, have more energy and use less effort to do poses that currently seem out of reach. </p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-124" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg" alt="monk feet yoga alignment rose petal" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />During a class always think about your feet. We always hear teachers telling us to ground our feet but what that actually means is distribute your weight evenly into all four corners of the feet which are your inner and outer heel, your big toe mound and your pinky toe mound. To get a good feel for what we are aiming for here, stand in Tadasana. Lift all your toes, and then the area on the ball of your foot underneath the big toe feel that area press downwards and back towards your inner heel. Then do the same with the area underneath your pinky toes, pushing downwards and back towards your outer heels. Then allow the rest of the toes to come down to the floor. The point of this is to feel the arches lift and activate the legs. You will notice how much more grounded and stable you are. If you are not grounded, it is very hard to maintain a solid and spacious pose.</p>
<p>The same also applies when placing our hands. Fingers should be spread wide pointing forwards and the pads underneath our knuckles should press firmly into the mat as well as your fingertips. Do not collapse into the heels of your hands as this will put unnecessary strain on your wrists. You want to imagine you are creating a suction pad with your hands which will then help to support the weight you can put on your hands particularly in arm balancing poses.</p>
<p>We are always looking for space in our asanas. We never want to feel bunched up or like areas of our body are collapsing into other parts of our body. We want to be always lengthening from our spine (unless specifically instructed to do otherwise), softening our shoulders to avoid tension and keeping our necks long. As a teacher, the amount of times I see students collapsing in poses like Trikonasana just because they want to touch the floor, forgetting the point of the asana. Use your blocks, that&#8217;s what they are there for to help you find space in a pose.</p>
<p>Lastly, but by no means least focus on the breath. The breath is energetically nourishing the anatomical posture and therefore should be our primary focus. Aligning our breath with our movement allows us to move a little easier through the poses. Our minds become quiet which means our focus increases.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-123" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg" alt="sidayoga yoga buddha body mind spirit" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-800x450.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When practising yoga, all the asanas should work for you in a good way and not cause any pain or discomfort. Make sure to inform your teacher of any injuries and remember a class is not a posture race. Use the verbal cues from your teacher as a guide to reach a deeper connection with a pose and don&#8217;t be afraid to use any props that are available to you. As soon as one stage of a pose becomes easy, understand when your body is ready to move on or go deeper, but take your time. Alignment may appear to be physically focused but the mind&#8217;s role is just as important. Alignment of the body, mind and spirit will mean your practice will become stronger, more steady and ultimately more relaxed. </p>
<p>Namaste</p>

<p>Although my trip to Bali was all the way back in October last year, I wanted to make it my first post as it was such an awesome experience from both yoga and cultural perspectives. </p>
<p>I had always been itching to go to Bali. I&#8217;d heard so many fantastic things about the place, from the food to the people and of course the wide variety of yoga options on offer. I am lucky enough to travel a lot with my partner for photography but we are always so focused on working that I wanted an experience that was just for me, doing something I was passionate about.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, one of my favourite teachers <a href="http://www.felayoga.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fela Adebiyi</a>, regularly hosts retreats in Bali and as I am a big fan of his style of teaching it wasn&#8217;t a difficult decision to book myself a place.</p>
<p>Arriving at a crazy hour the night before in Ubud I was definitely in need of some rejuvenation. It had been a few months since I had left Shanghai and I was excited to meet everyone and get stuck in to six days of yoga immersion glory.</p>
<p>Our mornings were spent together doing dynamic hatha yoga classes to really boost our energy. Sessions were pitched at the perfect level with modifications for the real beginners and deeper options for those of us that wanted an extra challenge. </p>
<p>I love Fela&#8217;s style and I always learn something new in his classes. He makes the impossible seem possible, pushes each and every one of us to our limits whilst still keeping it fun. Add the peaceful location and I was in yoga heaven.</p>
<p>We stayed and had our classes at the White Lotus, which was a stone&#8217;s throw away from Ubud Palace and about a five minute walk from rice paddy fields satisfying my camera-clicking fingers. </p>
<p>Ubud market is also only five minutes away but even on our quiet little street we were spoilt with places to buy those much needed souvenirs. I may have been guilty of purchasing a tad too many yoga tops and a phallic shaped wooden bottle opener <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f633.png" alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> , which meant I then had to buy a fancy bag to put it all in obviously. I figured I was allowed as everything purchased was a bargain!</p>
<p>There are so many places in Ubud offering yoga classes and it&#8217;s super cheap. <a href="http://www.ubudyogahouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubud Yoga House</a> was just minutes from where we were staying and <a href="http://theyogabarn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Yoga Barn</a> had a huge variety of classes on offer everyday. You will also find flyers for every class going at local cafes and restaurants so the choice is endless.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-72" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/temple-yoga-bali-travel-explore-indonesia-sida-sidayoga-victoria-teacher-retreat-forest-green-nature-300x225.jpg" alt="temple yoga bali travel explore indonesia soda sidayoga victoria teacher retreat forest green nature" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/temple-yoga-bali-travel-explore-indonesia-sida-sidayoga-victoria-teacher-retreat-forest-green-nature-300x225.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/temple-yoga-bali-travel-explore-indonesia-sida-sidayoga-victoria-teacher-retreat-forest-green-nature-800x600.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/temple-yoga-bali-travel-explore-indonesia-sida-sidayoga-victoria-teacher-retreat-forest-green-nature.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We even got the opportunity to visit Pura Gunung Kawi Sebatu Temple and Sebatu waterfall. Here a priestess performed melukat, a ceremony to purify the mind and soul spiritually. Well, when in Rome!</p>
<p>Melukat is a ceremony involving prayers and offerings, and a particularly bracing soak in the holy waterfall. The idea is to ward off negative forces so you can lead a more prosperous and peaceful life. To be fair, anything to help with that, I&#8217;m game &#8211; although I did struggle with the waterfall. The power of the ice cold water meant I couldn&#8217;t breathe and it kind of felt like I was getting repeatedly thumped on my head…hard. Maybe it was just negative energy leaving me I just wish it hadn&#8217;t hurt so much.  </p>
<p>In our afternoon classes we took it down a notch with slow, restorative classes &#8211; the perfect way to wind down the day. Using yoga bolsters and blocks to support various parts of the body, we were taken on a journey of pure relaxation. I find the effects of restorative classes incredible. By focusing on just the breath you reach a place where you aren&#8217;t completely awake but you aren&#8217;t unconscious either meaning you leave a class feeling like you have spent hours in a spa.</p>
<p>Talking of spas and all things relaxing, Golden Hands Therapeutic Massage on Jalan Kajeng Street is run by husband and wife team, Dewa and Oka. With a basic room featuring a curtain divider between two beds and bike helmets decorating the wall it&#8217;s no five star luxury, but it&#8217;s the masseuse that&#8217;s important not the surroundings. Genuinely, the best massage I have ever had &#8211; so much so I went back another two times. Somehow I don&#8217;t think the place is called Golden Hands for nothing, and at only a fiver, Bali was fast becoming one of my favourite places. </p>
<p>I had also become addicted to coconuts. Nothing really beats a fresh coconut in the morning to rehydrate after a class. That wasn&#8217;t the only super food on offer in Ubud either. I was amazed by the choice of restaurants offering local organic produce, and the raw chocolate and coffee is just to die for.</p>

I have. It&#8217;s the most expensive coffee in the world and is also known as cat poo coffee &#8211; yeh gross, but bear with me&#8230;</p>
<p>A luwak coffee plantation in Tegallalang is worth a visit if you are even slightly intrigued by the process. Luwaks munch on the ripest coffee beans and as they are digested, a unique fermentation process occurs and that gives the coffee its distinct flavour. The beans are washed (thoroughly), dried, pounded and then roasted. If you can get your head around the rather unique way it&#8217;s produced, this coffee is definitely worth a try &#8211; it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>For me, Bali is one of my perfect getaways. Enough yoga to make me smile for weeks, incredible food and some really special people. We all had an amazing time and I was very sorry to leave. Never mind though, whilst sipping on my Vita Coco (they promise &#8216;it&#8217;s like sticking a straw in a coconut&#8217;) and writing this post, it&#8217;s time to start planning my next trip <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
