								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1071495136-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As a yoga teacher I hear and see this all the time; &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing that&#8217; or &#8216;My legs/torso/arms/(insert other here) are too short/long&#8217;. Or, I get the quiet ones who just tend to look at me in horror waiting for the challenge to be over and we move on to something more accessible.</p>
<p>Unless you have an injury or a similar reason for not being able to do the posture or challenge, then I always expect my students to at least give it a go. &#8216;Just try&#8217; I say.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-735 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-848216056-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Sometimes students fall or lose balance and I smile and say &#8216;That&#8217;s awesome! That shows me you went for it&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t try, you will be forever stuck where you are, unable to progress and running away from challenges rather than facing them. I try to encourage my students to take what they learn on the mat, away with them off the mat. If what you learnt from your class that day was to stick your head in the stand and shy away from a posture then that&#8217;s not really what I want you to take away from my class. I want you to feel empowered, strong and wanting to do more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-745 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png 290w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1158x1200.png 1158w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-800x829.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920.png 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>I also HATE the word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; in an asana practice. Instead, I explain to my class&#8230;it&#8217;s just &#8216;not yet&#8217;. This is the mantra I try to repeat as often as possible to those students who just feel stuck and run away. I find this re-phrasing tends to resonate with people more than me putting my strict teacher face on. I like to give an example of something that they can do today that they couldn&#8217;t do before. The simplest example I can think of is walking. We cannot walk from birth, this is something we learn to do. It may take us 9 months to a year (or even longer) of falling on our backsides before we take our first steps, but it happens with time and patience, and it&#8217;s really as simple as that.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to asanas you currently find impossible to achieve. We live in a world where many of us want instant gratification and quite often, we don&#8217;t want to put in the hard work required to nail the posture. What&#8217;s even worse is when it can take years to make even the smallest shift to progress.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, some students can take the &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach. &#8216;I can&#8217;t get there right now so why bother?&#8217; </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-753 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
It can feel disheartening when you can&#8217;t yet do something. Especially when the shape looks simple enough. It&#8217;s very easy to take the &#8216;can&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do&#8217; route, when I can guarantee there is a possible path to the posture that will work for you right now. Take the modifications and make use of props and yoga toys to make yourself feel supported in the posture. Find <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">tutorials online</a> to help give you ideas on how you can make a posture more accessible. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-749 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1171447238-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Something that one of my favourite yogis <a href="https://www.elvisgarciayoga.com">Elvis Garcia</a> mentioned in one of his online classes I took years ago, still sticks with me today; &#8216;Any part of the pose is still the pose&#8217;. I absolutely LOVE this and it&#8217;s so so true. Let&#8217;s take the example of Bakasana (Crow pose). Even working on lifting your hips higher from Malasana pose while you plant the hands is still <em>part</em> of the pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feet stay on the ground or not. We are training our bodies into the shape of the posture and working our muscle memory so we get one step closer to our goal. You can still engage the bandhas and find the correct protraction of the shoulders even with the feet firmly planted on the ground. Sitting on your butt and willing the moment to pass, <i>isn&#8217;t </i>part of the pose and you will never get there in a month of Sundays. If something is holding you back figure out what that is and work with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s a fear of falling in which case <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sidayoga/videos/1652540961451389/">pad the space around you</a> with as many pillows you can find, and then just fall. A soft landing with arm balances can really help take the fear out of the attempt, which might be the very thing holding you back.</p>
<p>I am a curvy girl with boobs and I&#8217;ve had teachers tell me some postures will never be in my repertoire. Well poo to that! Certain postures might not come as easy to me as others, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up. I&#8217;m going to work with the goods God gave me and make it work, and you know what &#8211; this hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>Get out of your head. Just because thousands of people on Instagram can do that handstand you can&#8217;t quite nail yet, don&#8217;t be under any illusion. They probably had to work their a$$es off to get there. Strength drills, flexibility exercises, shoulder opening and dedication&#8230;every day. That famous yoga <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yogaeverydamnday/?hl=en">hashtag</a> exists for a reason!</p>
<p>And guys and gals please&#8230; there is NO SUCH THING AS CAN&#8217;T &#8211; just NOT YET!</p>
<p>Start thinking like Frodo and get your Fellowship together and start that long journey. Just like the Fellowship, you will have some serious hurdles to climb, and perhaps you will often feel like giving up, but commit yourself to the process. You won&#8217;t save Middle Earth, but I can guarantee you will feel incredible when you eventually realise the goals that you feel are impossible today. In fact, the longer the journey, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when you finally get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Here is my advice on how to <del>save Middle Earth</del> get one step closer to your asana goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAKE THE MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teacher offers a variation to a challenging pose, try it. There is no requirement to shoot and score the pose the first try. Feel it out. Maybe grab your blocks and a strap and see how the props can help with the pose. Try not to rely on them too much, particularly in the example of using the wall for inversions &#8211; it&#8217;s very easy to get to a place where your best friend and crutch turns into something you rely on too much and again you can become stuck, or get used to incorrect alignment which can cause injury.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF THE POSE</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-756 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/handstand-preop-with-block-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Is the posture one that opens up the shoulders? Or perhaps it&#8217;s completely focused on the core. In which case, take some time to practice drills that will build strength or open up the body in those areas. If you are even attempting arm balancing you should be warming up your wrists before you bear weight on your hands. Look at what the pose is asking from you and then do some extra homework to make the goal pose that little bit more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yoga-pose-plank-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Progress may happen quickly or slowly but however long it takes, take the time to check in and look at how far you have come. Maybe you are managing a kick up handstand to the wall now, after starting at zero. Perhaps holding plank pose for those extra 10 seconds is alot more doable. This is all progress and looking at how far you have come gives you a good indication of how far you have to go and makes the end goal way more realistic. </p>
<ul>
<li>CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanumanasana (full splits) for example takes time. You need open hip flexors and hamstrings and quite often these areas are a tight spot for many people, especially if you are an athlete. As the body gradually opens the more you practice, take a moment to celebrate every time you get closer and closer to the full posture. Celebrate and take joy in every miracle millimetre. It&#8217;s a good reminder that it&#8217;s the journey that matters not the destination.</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GO YOU! You’ve finally found a yoga class that you love and a teacher you connect with and have gotten into a routine of getting that cute butt on your mat as often as possible.<br />
And then what? Your yoga teacher only goes and buggers off on holiday/yoga retreat/teacher training/insert other here.<br />
How bloody annoying! Now what are you supposed to do? Sit on the sofa, twiddle one’s thumbs and maybe see what’s new on Netflix. Well here’s another idea… Roll out that mat and develop a wonderful self-practice of your own! Not only will you discover a new level of self-discipline but you will also find self-motivation in your home environment which can be challenging at first, but oh so rewarding if you keep at it.</p>
<p>I feel obliged to write this blog post as I myself am one of those yoga teachers. I’m often away from my students as I have another full time job (like most instructors), that often means I have to travel abroad. I am very fortunate though. The venues I teach at are always incredibly supportive, and the teachers that cover my classes are seriously brilliant, but I’m very aware that for some students they stay at home (not practising) keeping a close eye on my social media to check when I’m back in the country ready to teach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-627" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol-teacher-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Let’s not forget bank holidays and the Christmas break – it’s absolutely glorious to munch on Lebkuchen and wash it down with a mulled wine while watching Harry Potter, but neglecting a consistent practice can leave you stiff, unbalanced, and well, not quite right.</p>
<p>Your practice doesn’t have to stop because your teacher is away or poorly or if it’s Christmas or summer vacation. First of all, classes are usually covered rather than cancelled (unless it’s last minute or a holiday) and it gives you a beautiful opportunity to experience wisdom from another teacher. I personally love variety. I know what I like and what I don’t but I also love the chance to see how a different teacher operates and sequences a class.</p>
<p>BUT many of us are set in our ways and like our routine – especially us Brits. Therefore a missed class can have more of an impact than just a minor inconvenience. We can feel more stressed and bad tempered without our regular yoga fix.<br />
In my own practice, I usually carve out 2 hours a day for asana and meditation, but when I travel for work this is often impossible. Depending on where I am going and what I am doing, I’m lucky to squeeze in a weekly class which of course massively disrupts my chi.</p>
<p>In my opinion, developing your own practice is essential if you attend classes regularly. Most yogis will practise yoga in some form every day. You only have to look to hard core Ashtangis who are so disciplined they practise 6 days a week.<br />
For the average person who just wants to use yoga for an escape once a week this can be an absurd ask. I often give my students homework but know that less than 10% will actually practice at home.<br />
So what do we do about it?<br />
First of all, figure out realistically how much time you can dedicate to your own practice. Maybe it&#8217;s small pockets of time here and there, or maybe when you really think about it, there is a nice gap one day of the week where you can shut the door and devote that time completely to yourself for some yoga.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-630" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiser.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <br />
Work and family life can make this really challenging, but be honest with yourself and work out how much time you can carve out for you. Maybe it means waking up a little earlier to squeeze in a short practice, or hitting the hay a bit later if you need something more restorative.<br />
If you need a little pick me up, even a few rounds of Sun Salutations can energise the body enough for the day ahead, so don’t be so hard on yourself if your free time for a yoga practice isn’t as much as you would like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-642 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/blog-awol2-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Once you have planned in some time for a practice, think about what you would like to work on. Maybe you use the time to work on some skills including more advanced asanas you want to eventually achieve. I personally like to spend more time in my own practice focusing on things that I find more challenging and after a good flow working on more advanced asana allows me to monitor my own progress in strength and flexibility.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-645" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/youtube-2617510_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you need something more structured you can always look at the plethora of classes available online.<br />
Now your thoughts might instantly be directed to YouTube but I would err on the side of caution here. While there are some amazing instructors on YouTube offering some awesome classes, there is also A LOT of rubbish out there. Quite often you have to trawl through a lot of irrelevant and disappointing classes to find the golden nuggets. I have spent hours finding some good classes on YouTube but to be honest, I only really use it for help with something specific and usually that’s a 5-10 minute tutorial that I use in addition not instead of my practice.<br />
The attraction of YouTube is that it’s free. However, it drives me insane when the adverts pop up and like I said, for me finding a class I love is often like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>What is WAY more effective for me personally is on-demand yoga classes that are taught by my favourite teachers. Yoga teachers whose style I like and who are going to make me feel amazing afterwards. I apply the same attitude as I would when picking a regular yoga class – the teacher matters.<br />
Therefore, if your regular teacher is away and unable to teach your regular class, why not see if they offer a class online? On-demand classes are usually the fraction of the cost of a regular yoga class and you can have them on your computer or smartphone whenever you want them.<br />
For my own personal practice this is the way forward for me. I live in a remote part of the country where advanced classes are quite rare and often what I am personally looking for isn’t available and if it is, it’s at a time when I’m unable to make the class or workshop.<br />
Online classes are also perfect if you are busy and work full time. Fitting in a class at home when it suits you is way more time efficient than hop footing it to class when you factor in how long it takes to get to and from the studio. For example, if I’m teaching a single one hour class it can easily take me two hours minimum and that’s not factoring in the time I like to allow myself before class to greet my students and the time after class to answer any questions. It really doesn’t take a mathematician to work out the time benefits of a home practice.</p>

This is one of the main reasons I created my <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. As a teacher I want to reach out to as many people as possible sharing the benefits of my style of teaching as well as offer an alternative to those who, for whatever reason, cannot make it to class. As a student who loves a regular home practice, I wanted to produce classes online that I would want to do, that had enough varied content and useful information to encourage stay-at-home yogis to develop a regular practice wherever they may be.</p>
<p>These awesome online courses when taken together with your regular classes at the studio or the gym result in a beautiful well-rounded practice that will reap benefits of a solid, safe and strong practice which will help you to progress not only physically but mentally as well.</p>

<p>Another fantastic way to get your yoga fix or even in addition to your regular routine is to find a good yoga podcast. <br />
There are so many incredible teachers who host podcasts full of help and advice on how to deepen your practice, yoga philosophy and even help on how to develop your own practice. When I don&#8217;t have some sci-fi fantasy novel playing on my audible app, I&#8217;m usually listening to a decent yoga podcast. Again, like YouTube some channels I connect with and some I really don&#8217;t, but the beauty of this is that you can expand your knowledge and understanding during your commute or doing daily tasks.</p>
<p>So rather than feel put out if your regular class gets cancelled, check out other options that might work for you. You may just find some online yoga gold, a new community and some awesome new teachers to practice with.</p>
