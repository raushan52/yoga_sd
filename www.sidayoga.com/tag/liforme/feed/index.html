								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing a yoga mat is as personal as choosing a watch or a new pair of shoes (in my opinion).</p>
<p>A number of factors determine which one you buy, whether that be budget, eco-friendly manufacturing procedures or grip.</p>
<p>I look for two main things when purchasing a yoga mat. I need really good grip (I do get my sweat on), and I need it to wear well, although this isn&#8217;t as important as grip.</p>
<p>My first &#8216;proper&#8217; yoga mat was a Lululemon mat and I still recommend those mats to clients. During my teacher training back in 2015 one of my friends had a Liforme Mat. I marvelled at the AlignForMe<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> system and must admit I had mat envy, but I almost choked on my tea when I learnt the price. It was more than twice what I paid for mine and I dismissed getting one immediately.</p>
<p>Roll on two years later and a generous visit from Santa Claus and hey presto I had one and I was over the moon. </p>
<p>I wanted to review this mat for you, as I get many students ask me about what mat I use and the <a href="https://liforme.com/products/liforme-yoga-mat-grey">Liforme mat</a> is my go-to for my daily home practice. It was good timing too, as I had just bought a new one so we could compare and contrast the wear and tear as well.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>THE GRIP IS AMAZING</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The grip on my Liforme mat is just brilliant and I&#8217;ve put this bad boy through its paces. It&#8217;s been to countless hot yoga classes and even a 3 hour workshop in a hot room my trusty mat never failed. I absolutely love this mat for arm balancing and inversions as I feel a bit more supported. Even if I am sweating, I still feel safe balancing on my hands.</p>
<p>The grip is so good, it can take some time to get used to for Vinyasa, especially Chaturanga to Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana. This doesn&#8217;t bother me especially, but could niggle hard core Ashtangis in the beginning.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>THE ALIGNFORME<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> SYSTEM </strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-853" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme3-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" />This is perfect for a beginner or someone who does the majority of their <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">yoga practice at home</a>. It has been meticulously designed for all sorts of body shapes and heights, but make sure you don&#8217;t fall victim to the &#8216;all the gear no idea&#8217; syndrome. Even with the markers, you need to use them according to your body.</p>
<p>I use the hand markers slightly differently to the recommendations as I like using the lower hand marker to align my wrists. This works really nicely for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful feature is the central line. Admittedly there is nothing stopping you taking a <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2016/03/alignment-connection-rather-than-correction/">sharpie to your standard mat</a>, but people tend to be less than keen to deface their stuff. </p>
<p>I personally love this <a href="https://liforme.com/pages/align-for-me">system</a>. When used correctly it can help with a really safe and steady practice when you don&#8217;t have access to adjustment. The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">Coronavirus</a> outbreak means I am only verbal cuing in my classes and avoiding physical adjustment, so if there was ever a time to buy this mat, it&#8217;s now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>BIODEGRADABLE &amp; PVC FREE</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Liforme have spent a lot of time, money and effort to produce a high-quality, eco-friendly mat. It&#8217;s PVC-free and apparently biodegrades in landfill within 1-5 years, which is actually brilliant. It&#8217;s non-toxic and doesn&#8217;t have that horrid &#8216;new mat&#8217; smell when you first open it up.</p>
<p>I love this and it&#8217;s nice to know my yoga practice and slight mat purchasing addiction isn&#8217;t ruining the planet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>LARGER THAN A STANDARD MAT</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually didn&#8217;t realise that the Liforme mats were slightly longer and wider than standard yoga mats. This is great if you are taller than average. A quick Google search tells me the standard mat measures about 172 cm long and 60cm wide. Liforme mats measure 185cm long and 68cm wide so that&#8217;s some significant inch gain right there.</p>
<p>If you are super tall like my fella, you may want to look at a mat that has been designed accordingly. <a href="https://eu.manduka.com/products/manduka-pro-yoga-mat?variant=30199675256883">Manduka</a> offer a mat for sale that measures up to 215cm long which is ideal for tall folks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>CHARITY DONATIONS</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love a company that gives back? By purchasing from their <a href="https://liforme.com/collections/giving-back">Purple Earth, White Magic or Zodiac</a> range, a percentage of profits goes to <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk">Friends of the Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk">RSPCA</a>.</p>
<h3>CONS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>PRICEY</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cheapest standard yoga mat available is currently £80 as Liforme are offering a discount until tomorrow. This is definitely on the pricier end of the mat-buying spectrum, and those that have a strict budget might not be able to justify the higher price tag. Perhaps you only attend one or two classes a week and just won&#8217;t get the &#8216;value-for-use&#8217;.</p>
<p>Personally, I think you get what you pay for. I use my mat everyday so I need the best mat I can afford. The Liforme mats are worth every penny in my opinion, but if too pricey look for offers throughout the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>ANT FOOD</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These mats are basically chocolate pudding for ants! They are biodegradable which is awesome, but when using outside they attract the bugs.</p>
<p>Last October I took my Liforme mat with me to a stunning Shala where it was all open plan &#8211; think at one with nature. However, it didn&#8217;t take long for my mat to attract any creepy crawly within walking distance. </p>
<p>It did affect me a bit as I was forever swatting and pushing them off my mat which was a little annoying. At first, I couldn&#8217;t work out why I was an ant-magnet. Then I noticed my originally-pristine mat was now pretty damaged as the result of a Mad Anter&#8217;s Tea Party.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I&#8217;d rather have a planet-friendly mat than be too bothered about the damage but it is a bit of a bugger when you think how much the mats are in the first place.</p>
<p>My damaged one will now be my dedicated outdoor mat for the summer, as I now have a spare. If you only have one mat, consider using something else outside or use super strong insect repellant. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme4-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>WEARS AND ATTRACTS MARKS</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the Manduka mats I have purchased, the Liforme mats wear a little more. Personally, I still think the wearing out is pretty excellent and as I buy the grey mats I don&#8217;t notice the dirt as much. </p>
<p>Liforme have just launched a <a href="https://liforme.com/products/liforme-white-magic-mat">White Magic mat</a>, which is simply a stunning work of art. I do however worry about how this mat might look in a few months time. Although, having said that, the team at Liforme have taken measures to reduce this issue so I guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>Personally I love black and I clean my mat religiously so it&#8217;s not a huge issue for me, but the Mrs Hinch wannabes might struggle.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><strong><em>BAG STRAP IS UNCOMFORTABLE</em></strong></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-863" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme5-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></em></strong><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Although the bag is complimentary, I&#8217;m not really a fan. Where they have placed the clip fastening for me is extremely uncomfortable. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">How I carry the bag, this clip sits right on my shoulder and it just digs in. Maybe I have super sensitive shoulders, but I&#8217;d rather the clip be the other end as the padding is fixed so I can&#8217;t move it. </span></p>
<p>To be honest, this is my home practice mat and I only really take it out the house for workshops or trainings, so again not a huge issue for me, but could annoy those with sensitive shoulders &#8211; like me.</p>
<p>The bag is also complimentary with the mat purchase but I wanted to mention it as it is annoying.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h6><em><strong>ONLY ONE THICKNESS (4.2mm)</strong></em></h6>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">If you are super sensitive on the knees or joints, the 4.2mm thickness on these mats </span><em style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">might </em><span style="color: #555555; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">not be enough for you.</span></p>
<p>Personally, if you suffer from knee sensitivity, I would suggest buying separate knee pads anyway. A small towel or blanket can also do the job here. </p>
<p>However, if you don&#8217;t want to be buying extra kit, you may want to look at thicker mats available. The cushioning on the Liforme mats is great, but I don&#8217;t suffer from pain in my knees so it&#8217;s difficult to advise here. If you need more padding though, Manduka do offer 6mm thick mats as well as a whopping 8mm thick yoga mat. </p>
<h3>OVERALL</h3>
<p>8.5-9/10</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-865" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-300x253.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="253" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-300x253.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-1200x1012.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-1536x1295.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-2048x1727.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/product-review-liforme-6-800x674.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ve only deducted points for the ant issue, price and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t wear as well as other mats I&#8217;ve bought.</p>
<p>However, this is THE mat I will always recommend especially if you love alignment, inversions and arm balancing.</p>
<p>The grip is insanely good and if you mainly have a home practice, it is a must-buy. Plus, it&#8217;s also nice to know that my practice isn&#8217;t damaging the planet &#8211; a few ants here and there is a small sacrifice I guess 😉</p>
