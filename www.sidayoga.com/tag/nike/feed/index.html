<p>While I have full respect for the naked yogis out there, I don&#8217;t really want my wobbly bits on show when I&#8217;m practising even if it is 100 degrees outside.</p>
<p>My practise these days feels different. Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Rocket and Power yoga are not just a challenge but feel practically impossible. My mat needs a daily clean from my sweat and I&#8217;m chugging through more water than I ever thought possible&#8230;.Ah, it must be Summer.</p>
<p>I love pushing myself in my practice, but with the temperature soaring outside even the simplest vinyasas can feel like Mount Everest. It dawned on me during a recent workshop I ran that my students felt it too. A group normally happy to practise as many arm balances and floating vinyasas that 90 minutes would allow, were fatigued half way through the session. Taking it down a notch was very necessary!</p>
<p>So what does one do? In the UK air conditioning isn&#8217;t really the standard unless you are in a fancy gym, and while my generous boyfriend bought me a Dyson fan, it&#8217;s not the ideal solution. However, there are ways we can change up our practise so we are more comfortable with our yoga practise in the summer months. </p>
<p>Here are my Golden Rules for Summer:</p>
<p><strong>Drink, Drink Drink</strong></p>
<p>A pretty obvious one, but the most important. When we practise in the heat we sweat more which is our body&#8217;s way of cooling us down. In turn, we become dehydrated which means our body loses more water than it takes in. I remember when I was practising Bikram yoga on a regular basis, I would always get severe headaches after class because I wasn&#8217;t drinking enough fluids. </p>
<p>To combat this, I made sure I drank my minimum 3 litres of water a day (yes we hear it all the time), making sure I was drinking before and after a yoga class. </p>
<p>When we are dehydrated our blood volume decreases which means there is less blood to go to the working muscles. You may want to consider taking Electrolytes but avoid high sugar energy drinks that are packed with sugar and empty calories. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-397" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-scaled-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/drinking-water-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I would even drink coconut water after an especially sweat-inducing class. My headaches disappeared immediately. Coconut water is excellent for dehydration and contains potassium, magnesium, antioxidants and a number of other benefits making it my go-to drink when I exercise. It also tastes a lot nicer than those god awful salty blackcurrant dehydration sachets. Birch water is also a great option, but it is a little harder to get hold of. In the UK I have only ever seen it in Waitrose and Health Food shops.</p>
<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t wait until you are thirsty to rehydrate. Keep a bottle of water with you at all times and try to avoid alcohol (that&#8217;s a tough one) and caffeine. Invest in a Citrus Zinger or something similar to pimp up your water, after all 3 litres a day can get dull quick. Add citrus fruit, cucumber, mint or berries &#8211; really the only limitations are your imagination. </p>
<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>
<p>My first ever yoga class was hardly a fashion parade, more a case for the fashion police, not that that matters but it is funny looking back. Now I am not saying you need to hop down to the nearest sports store and spend a small fortune on figure flattering &#8216;sexy&#8217; yoga gear (although I love a spree in Lululemon myself), but it is important you wear the right clothing. </p>
<p>Needless to say, my thick, bobbled, saggy sweatpants and t-shirt I got free in some random event goody bag did not cut the mustard for what turned out to be a rather sweaty yoga class.</p>
<p>My clothes clung to me, I felt uncomfortable and quite frankly, gross. My cheap/free kit rode up in places where it shouldn&#8217;t and felt kind of heavy the hotter I got. I learnt very quickly that high-performance sportswear made from polyester that draws sweat away from the body was a sensible investment for yoga in the heat. I personally love Nike Dri-Fit, GapFit, Calvin Klein Performance and Adidas Climalite, but of course yoga brands like Lululemon and Alo also have their own range of high performance clothing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-409" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat2-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>I also tend to wear a sports bra that I can wear without a tank top over the top &#8211; so something less &#8216;underweary&#8217;. I like to feel supported, and while I don&#8217;t revel in getting my midriff out (was never a fan of crop tops), it&#8217;s nice to have the option I can de-layer if the heat gets too much. </p>
<p>Shorts are also an excellent option <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> One of my male friends practises in his favourite pair of black running shorts and never wears anything else, even in the colder months (!). The main thing is just make sure you are comfortable and save the long-sleeved tops and hoodies until Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down and Listen to Your Body</strong></p>
<p>The main thing here is to use your common sense. Asanas should feel good, you should be able to breathe easily and most of all you should be enjoying yourself. If it starts to feel like you are climbing Mount Fuji, it&#8217;s time to take stock and pay more attention to your body and how you feel during your class.</p>
<p>I teach a lot of Vinyasa yoga, often with a focus on core and strength. This can be even more of a challenge in the summer.</p>
<p>Some of the places I teach actually have air-conditioning, but many do not. The glorious sunshine peering into the windows can be beautiful to practise in, but you sure do feel it if your mat happens to be in the sunlight&#8230;slipping much?</p>
<p>A solution to a power yoga style class in the heat is to take it down a notch. Whether this is changing your Vinyasa from the traditional: Phalakasana (Plank pose), Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward Facing Dog), Ardha Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog), consider this: </p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-411" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat3-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></b>Bharmanasana (Table Top), Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose), Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose), Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose).</p>
<p>Make sure you stay a little longer in Savasana (Corpse pose) at the end of class to give your body time to recuperate. Well, you don&#8217;t have to ask me twice! Zzzzzzzzz</p>
<p>You could even skip the Vinyasa and take Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose) &#8211; this is an option that is always available to you when the practice gets too much. Anything works as a Vinyasa as long as you link the breath with movement. </p>
<p>The Golden Rule &#8216;Quality over Quantity&#8217; rings true here. Modify and come down to the knees and use props to create space and go easy on yourself. It is much better to lower to a Chaturanga whilst on your knees than just collapse into the shoulders and the wrists through heat exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on Flexibility</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-403 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-scaled-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/splits-monkey-pose-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Use the heat to your advantage! I love a strength-focused practice, but sometimes it is just too darn hot.</p>
<p>On super hot and humid days, consider a practice focused on flexibility or even Yin Yoga. </p>
<p>The heat increases the blood flow into the muscles resulting in more flexibility. Warm muscles mean it is easier to relax in intense stretches thereby increasing your overall flexibility. Add Yin yoga to the mix and that&#8217;s some serious fascia massage happening right there. </p>
<p>June and July could be just the right time to start setting goals to get into those stretchy poses on your checklist. There are tonnes of inspirational journey goals on Instagram which helps with your motivation. This could be just the boost you need to start your Hanumanasana (full splits) journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Practise in the Morning or the Evening</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-400 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-scaled-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luxury-beach-yoga-A-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The best time to practise in the summer is before 10am and after 3pm. The sun is at it&#8217;s hottest during this time and unless you want a Bikram style practice, it&#8217;s better to avoid an afternoon yoga session.</p>
<p>If you are outside for your practice, make sure you wear sunscreen. This might be a case of teaching your Grandmother to suck eggs here, but it is important. A baseball cap is also a great option for keeping the sun off your face, and you will always find me sporting a pair of sunnies <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p><strong>Try something different</strong></p>
<p>Summer is a great opportunity to try something different. If you live in a city, rooftop yoga at sunrise can be a lovely way to change up your practice, or even beach yoga if you are lucky enough to live close to the sea.</p>
<p>I recently had a go at SUP yoga. I have lived by the sea for many years but never really considered SUP yoga until I found out a friend of mine was teaching a class just down the road from where I lived.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-401 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beattheheat1-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Of course, this is a style of yoga that is very much weather dependant, but it felt great to try something different. The weather was glorious and being on the ocean on a paddle board was so much fun. If I ever got too hot I could dip my toes into the water and cool off &#8211; grand!</p>
<p>Even the simplest of poses turned out to be a humbling experience. Your balance is challenged especially when you take the Drishti out of the equation &#8211; EVERYTHING moves. You have to ground your feet and hands a lot, make sure your alignment is as correct as it can be and above all else use that core! </p>
<p>You may fall in, but it&#8217;s so cool and lovely you may find yourself doing it deliberately!</p>
<p>The key here, is make the most of the summer and turn the heat into a positive element of your practice rather than something that just leaves you feeling hot and bothered.</p>
<p>Follow these simple rules and you will certainly &#8216;Beat the Heat&#8217;, and if all else fails, make sure your freezer is stocked with ice lollies and ice cream &#8211; you deserve it!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about working with my best friend and the fact that he is a photographer means we get to visit some incredible places. Most of our time is photograph-focused but if I get the chance I love to check out some of the local yoga studios during our travels.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-278" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/holiday-american-road-trip.jpg" alt="holiday-american-road-trip" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/holiday-american-road-trip.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/holiday-american-road-trip-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/holiday-american-road-trip-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Last November took us to Chicago Illinois, Jackson Wyoming, Las Vegas Nevada and Pismo Beach California where I was lucky enough to squeeze in some stretchy time in some seriously wonderful studios. Classes I was very grateful for &#8211; all that driving leaves one a tad stiff!</p>
<p>It has become a habit of mine to do a bit of research on yoga studios when I travel. I tend to leave it until I have arrived at my destination. Thanks to hotel WIFI and Yelp it is pretty easy to find your closest yoga studio especially if you are in the States. Another awesome thing about studios is that they are all competing for your business so they often do amazing introductory offers for new visitors and I even found a few classes that were donation based.  If you do end up paying full price though, expect the price to be around 10-20USD per class &#8211; maybe even more. This isn&#8217;t cheap considering the tiny town where I come from you rarely pay £10 for a class.</p>
<p>So here are my reviews of the studios I visited. Definitely take the time to visit the websites your search generates. That will be where you find any offers and whether the studio does classes in the styles you like. I found so much choice though, even in tiny Jackson so I am sure you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.corepoweryoga.com">CorePower Yoga</a>, </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Streeterville Studio, 227 E. Ontario St., Suite 202 Chicago, IL 60611</strong></em></p>
<p>This place is awesome, not only is it a chain so you are quite likely to find a CorePower yoga studio nearby, you can also get a free week of unlimited yoga as a new student &#8211; bargain! Classes are usually $25 for a drop-in so the money saving potential is vast if you sign up. Yes I may get a few spam emails as a result but easy enough to unsubscribe. Make sure you have a US phone number to add to the form though when you sign up. My hotel address sufficed but yeh worthy of having those details on you when you sign up to qualify for your free week. Even if the offer is no longer available or for some reason you can&#8217;t sign up, the classes are definitely worth paying for anyway &#8211; I was really impressed with the place.</p>
<p>The timetable is pretty full so you will easily be able to find a class that fits in with your busy travelling schedule. There are classes for beginners right through to the more experienced yogi and many of the classes are in heated rooms with humidity so make sure you check that out first and of course drink plenty of water if you choose a heated class. I personally LOVE hot yoga so it was an added bonus for me. </p>
<p>The classes I chose were both heated classes. In my experience, I have always found the level of classes in America to be quite high compared to that of the UK so opted for an intermediate class &#8211; CorePower Yoga 2 and  a beginner friendly class &#8211; Hot Power Fusion. I wish I could have squeezed in an advanced class as I felt I could have pushed myself that bit more, but the intermediate class is still great if you are an experienced student. It had also been a while since I had practised in heat so taking it down a notch or two was probably not a bad shout.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-271" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chicago.jpg" alt="chicago" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chicago.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chicago-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chicago-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />My first class was with Chelsea who offered a really nice balancing flow. Postures were held a little longer for the first sequence and then for the second and third round we followed our breath which is a style I really like and definitely something I will incorporate into some of my classes. Flowing in such a hot room allows you to &#8216;get your sweat on&#8217; as it were and I couldn&#8217;t help but feel my Apple watch fitness app should have been a lot higher considering how soaked my yoga kit was. </p>
<p>Hot Power Fusion was led by Lauren and boy does she know her stuff. Lauren reminded me a lot of my teachers back in Shanghai and I had immediate respect for her. This class wasn&#8217;t as busy as my first class which selfishly was great as it meant I got some great hands-on adjustment which was my favourite part of the class. Although the class was beginner friendly, I wouldn&#8217;t say it was easy, definitely more prompts and alignment cues but still a challenge &#8211; good for me as I like a challenge <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The staff at CorePower Yoga are lovely and really helpful with any questions you might have. The studio is modern and clean and have all the props you might need to help optimise your practice. I will definitely be returning to CorePower Yoga on future visits to the States but hoping I can do more than two classes next time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://inversionyoga.com">Inversion Yoga</a></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>290 N Millward St, PO Box 1075, Jackson Hole, WY 83001</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-275 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson-hole-wyoming-300x172.jpg" alt="jackson-hole-wyoming" width="300" height="172" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson-hole-wyoming-300x172.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson-hole-wyoming-800x457.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson-hole-wyoming.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The next stage of our trip took us to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. From a photography perspective there really are some stunning places to take pictures. Yes, it was a tad cold and somewhat unnerving with the wolves howling in the distance while we stood alone in the middle of nowhere snapping away but it really is a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Jackson Hole is pretty small but full of some gorgeous shops and restaurants &#8211; definitely the place to buy your cowboy boots. There is also a wonderful yoga studio there called Inversion Yoga and was probably the most inspiring of all the studios I visited during our trip. </p>
<p>I opted for the Ski Fit yoga class because it was different and I had never seen a class like this before. This is a seasonal class though so be sure to check the <a href="http://inversionyoga.com/schedule-healcode/">schedule</a> for an up to date version of what&#8217;s on and when. This class promised to get me ready for the ski season so lots of lower body work and core. To be honest, you don&#8217;t even need to be a skier to enjoy the benefits of this power-style class.</p>
<p>Kira was our teacher and she is just amazing. She had a prosthetic leg and trust me when I say she can do more with one leg than I can ever hope to achieve having two. Not only was her class incredibly challenging and well structured but with Kira&#8217;s friendly persona I was beyond inspired. It was more cardio based than I am used to but I really liked it. Kira&#8217;s tips for crow pose were just great and I am definitely going to incorporate jumping from Downward Dog to Malasana into my own classes &#8211; after 15 of those Child&#8217;s pose couldn&#8217;t be more welcome. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-273" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson.jpg" alt="jackson" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jackson-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />There are many different styles to choose from at Inversion Yoga, whether you are an Ashtanga fan, Iyengar, Kundalini etc, your needs are sure to be satisfied. They even have classes specifically for kids. You can book online or give them a call. I think I just popped in but to be honest I wouldn&#8217;t usually chance it as you never know how popular a class is when you are visiting a studio for the first time. I cannot wait to go back &#8211; one of my favourites <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong><em>107 E Charleston Blvd #145, Las Vegas, NV 89104, USA</em></strong></p>
<p>I love Vegas&#8230;the city of sin&#8230;.how very&#8230;.un-zen! Now yoga may not be on the top of your list if you find yourself in this part of the world and I wouldn&#8217;t blame you at all. There is however, ALOT of choice. Whether you are staying right on the strip or a little further afield you are very likely to find a class close to you. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-266 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/las-vegas-blog.jpg" alt="las-vegas-blog" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/las-vegas-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/las-vegas-blog-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/las-vegas-blog-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>My research on <a href="https://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> returned many options for classes, heck they even have classes where you can do your Sun Salutations in the company of <a href="https://www.mirage.com/en/amenities/siegfried-roys-secret-garden-and-dolphin-habitat.html">dolphins</a>! A tempting offer with spa access included in the price but the class times didn&#8217;t fit in with my Vegas schedule <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>We were staying at the <a href="http://wynnlasvegas.com">Wynn</a> Hotel which is one of my favourite hotels in Las Vegas. Aside from the casino, wide choice of restaurants and decor that will leave your jaw on the floor, the gym and spa are also insane. I have never really been a gym person&#8230;preferring classes to running on a fast conveyor belt or powering up the elliptical &#8211; it&#8217;s just not me. One thing you can be sure of though &#8211; gyms in Vegas tend to be quiet which for me makes them far more palatable. The Wynn Gym has the best machines and there is even a multi purpose room where I often got my stretch on. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t feel I needed to go to a class with such great facilities where I was staying, but for the purposes of this blog I wanted to see what else was out there.</p>
<p>A friend of mine suggested Blue Sky Yoga, an arts studio hosting donation based yoga classes. It was a little out of town, but as we had a hire car this wasn&#8217;t really an issue.</p>
<p>Cheryl our teacher, was warm and welcoming which is often quite rare in Vegas. The studio is simple &#8211; one room with a space outside to leave your shoes, but the walls are covered in art. Very cool.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-265" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas-164x300.jpg" alt="blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas" width="164" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas-164x300.jpg 164w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas-800x1459.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas-658x1200.jpg 658w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas-842x1536.jpg 842w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas-1123x2048.jpg 1123w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-sky-yoga-las-vegas.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 164px) 100vw, 164px" />I chose to participate in Restorative yoga and stayed on to try the Vinyasa class. Selfishly, I would have preferred it the other way around as I like to basically collapse after a Vinyasa session. Suitably relaxed after my restorative class the temptation to have a pre dinner nap was quite high. As I was with a friend of mine, we decided to stay as she was really keen to try the Vinyasa class. </p>
<p>Compared to the restorative session, this class was packed. People were squeezing their mats into every nook and cranny. I am not sure if it was because the time of the class was popular or whether it was more attractive because it was more energetic compared to the previous class. Either way I am glad we had first dibs on a space &#8211; I really hate squeezing myself in. </p>
<p>My friend is a beginner and found the Vinyasa class tough. Restorative was definitely her favourite out of the two, but Vinyasa is a shock to the system after basically spending an hour relaxing. I would say the class we had was in-between beginner and intermediate. The thing to remember when participating in a tough class is that Child&#8217;s pose is always an option, so if you find yourself struggling take a moment to re-connect with the breath. </p>
<p>Blue Sky Yoga is a really cool place to practice. I struggled with how busy the Vinyasa class was as I really don&#8217;t like having to keep an eye out for flying feet in my face but thats just me. It&#8217;s no surprise Cheryl&#8217;s classes are popular, she&#8217;s a great teacher and hosting donation based classes is certainly attractive &#8211; as I have mentioned before yoga in America can be super pricey.</p>
<p>The suggested donation is $12 per class which is a very fair price for what you get. This was probably the &#8216;oldest&#8217; studio I visited so equipment was more &#8216;used&#8217; than other places I visited but this never really puts me off. I usually travel with my own towel and mat anyway.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://harmony-house-yoga.com">Harmony House Yoga</a></strong></p>
<div class="street-address"><strong><em>991 Price St. <span class="locality">Pismo Beach</span>, <span class="region">CA</span>, <span class="postal-code">93449</span></em></strong></div>
<div class="street-address"> </div>
<div class="street-address">California is full of yoginis and yogis &#8211; wherever you go a pair of funky printed yoga pants usually aren&#8217;t too far from sight. </div>
<div class="street-address"> </div>
<div class="street-address">
<p>You really are spoilt for classes too and Pismo Beach is no exception. Relying on my trusty Yelp app I found I liked the sound of Harmony House Yoga. It was a five minute drive from where we were staying and after a sneak peak on their website the studio looked amazing.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. Friendly reception staff guided me towards a large beautiful room &#8211; it felt like a giant cabin, the sort of place you would be impressed by if you booked a yoga retreat. </p>
<p>Liz was our teacher for Vinyasa Flow &#8211; and this is one stretchy, spiritual lady. Liz knows a lot about chakras and it&#8217;s interesting to hear her thought processes and the theory behind the asanas in her class. The sequences were challenging enough and there were enough modifications to make this class suitable for all levels. </p>
<p>My favourite part was the venue itself &#8211; it really is beautiful. The sun coming through the window, lighting up such a large room just felt special. I have had mixed experiences with yoga in California. The classes are fine but often the atmosphere feels competitive and too much ego. I did not feel this at Harmony House Yoga and I would go back in a heartbeat.  </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Pismo-harmony-yoga.jpg" alt="Pismo-harmony-yoga" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Pismo-harmony-yoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Pismo-harmony-yoga-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Pismo-harmony-yoga-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />It is worth checking out their website before you go. There are often special events on and while I was there a donation based class was on offer with proceeds going to veterans. Also make sure you check out their shop, the yoga kit and mats on offer are of great quality and the prices aren&#8217;t too bad either.</p>
<p>So that was my American Road trip! Primarily there for the purpose of taking photographs and a rather hectic schedule work wise, but I still managed to squeeze in some yoga. What surprised me the most was that even in fairly remote locations there still seemed to be a really decent choice of classes showing how far ahead America is with yoga compared to the UK. Hopefully with more time the UK will get there too.</p>
</div>
<p>Choice may beat the UK hands down but classes are much pricier. Some classes I had a look at were as much as $50, which just leaves a bit of a sour taste. Most places also charge an extra couple of dollars to rent a mat too. I usually have my own but it&#8217;s still worth being aware of. </p>
<p>Also, if you have some spare dollars it is worth checking out the shops and boutiques that sell yoga gear. There are many places that specialise in some seriously funky stuff and prices aren&#8217;t bad either. For an even better bargain, head out to the shopping outlets. Nike and Adidas have some great sales and even with the pound not being so great right now you can still pick up a deal.</p>
<p>I would love to hear about your yoga experiences travelling and if you have any recommendations yourself, comment below <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently got asked by a good friend of mine in America what he should wear to a yoga class and what to buy to take with him. After a good hour of chatting online, I realised this would actually be a useful blog post for anyone starting their yoga journey.</p>
<p>For some people, their first yoga class can be incredibly daunting. The fear that everyone there will be far more advanced, balancing on every part of their body <em>except</em> their feet. It&#8217;s also common to feel intimidated by all the poses and wishing you had looked up what the word &#8216;asana&#8217; meant. Then on top of all that, wondering what on earth to wear and what you need to bring to a class.</p>
<p>Well first, don&#8217;t worry. I appreciate that&#8217;s easier said than done but there really is no need to stress out before you attend your first session. We have all been there. I remember my first class in Shanghai and being surrounded by the tiniest most flexible bodies I had ever seen. Everyone was meditating and I didn&#8217;t know whether I was supposed to join in or not, so I grabbed a mat and went to the back of the room hoping I could hide away in the small, 360 degree mirrored room. Fat chance, but being at the back in the corner at least made me feel better. I am now the exact opposite!</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-146" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-300x212.jpg" alt="silence quiet notice etiquette" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-300x212.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-800x566.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet-1200x848.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/silence-quiet.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Back then, I knew nothing of etiquette or what to bring. There was a notice on the door saying &#8216;Silence! No entry once class starts&#8217;, but that was my only introduction. I supposed it didn&#8217;t help that I was in a Chinese studio where English was pretty scarce, but I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I did learn pretty quickly that my old sweat pants and Abercrombie and Fitch T-shirt were not appropriate attire for a hot yoga class and bringing in a teacup of water was absolutely pointless.</p>
<p>So, you have made the mental decision to try a yoga class. Good for you! You have checked out the timetable at your local studio, you&#8217;ve made the phone call or sent an email and booked yourself in. Awesome.</p>
<p>Right&#8230;&#8230;what now?</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, it is worth doing a little bit of research on the different styles of yoga and the ones that are available at your local studio. Yoga studios and teachers usually have explanations of all the classes they offer on their websites. </p>
<p>Back to when I first started looking for a class, I knew I wanted to try hot yoga as I loved the idea of being able to stretch a little deeper than I could in a regular class, and I definitely wanted a faster paced class so for me Vinyasa yoga was a natural choice. I then tried every session going and discovered there were many styles I loved and some that didn&#8217;t quite work for me. </p>
<p><strong>What to wear</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you need is to be comfortable. You will be stretching a lot in class, so wear clothing that allows for that. For women, a decent sports bra and tight fitting top is a good idea if you practise inversions. In my opinion the <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/lingerie/bras/sports-bras-n-byrt4">sports bras</a> at Marks and Spencer are just brilliant because rather than small, medium and large they do actual bra sizes which I find are a far better fit. I once made the mistake of wearing a baggy T-shirt to class and my first attempt at a headstand meant the entire class got an eyeful. Needless to say, I did not make that error again. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-139" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-1200x182.jpg" alt="yoga clothing comfortable stretch" width="800" height="121" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-800x121.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-clothing-examples-300x46.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>If you feel a little self conscious wearing tight clothing then you can always tuck your top in to your yoga pants, but it is worth being aware if you ever go upside down in a class. </p>
<p>For guys, as long as you are comfortable and can stretch anything goes really. Most guys tend to wear shorts and a T-shirt but a lot of this comes down to personal preference. </p>
<p>There are times you can find yourself in an environment that feels like a yoga fashion show stocking the entire back catalogue of  Lululemon. I never really understood that. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a penchant for mad print leggings and I am rapidly becoming obsessed with yoga toe socks but that&#8217;s mainly because I spend a lot of time in my yoga gear and wanted to cheer up that part of my wardrobe. The reality is you need to feel comfortable in what you wear and make sure you can stretch.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is worth buying Dri Fit, Climacool, or similar quick-drying clothing. The faster paced classes and hot yoga will make you perspire and that doesn&#8217;t feel particularly nice during the winding down section of your class and when resting in Corpse pose or Savasana if you have what is essentially a sopping wet T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Just before class</strong></p>
<p>You should come to class on an empty stomach leaving at least 90 minutes to 2 hours since you last ate. If you come to class just after eating a meal, the energy that is needed for digestion is redirected to the muscles and the body is unable to digest food properly. It can also feel uncomfortable. During my training, many of the girls used to pop down to the local noodle shop and have the biggest bowl of carbs you have ever seen. By mid afternoon they were all bloated, sleepy and unable to focus on practice. They quickly learnt the hard way that maybe a big portion of noodles before yoga wasn&#8217;t the best idea. If you follow the 90 minute / 2 hour rule, energy will be focused on the poses and you will maximise the benefits of your practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-141" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-300x200.jpg" alt="waiting early class group sit relax" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groupshot-waiting-class-early.jpg 525w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Another tip is to make sure you get to the studio in plenty of time. The usual etiquette is to arrive 10-15 minutes before class starts. I usually use this time to relax and focus on my breathing or do a few exercises to open up my shoulders. Other people wait in a comfortable sitting position and meditate. I am not usually one for heavy etiquette rules but I do think arriving early is important. If you are running late and you are still allowed in the class (some classes do not allow you entry once class has started), make sure you enter the room as quietly as possible. Yoga requires a lot of concentration and focus and it can be really distracting if there are late arrivals.</p>
<p>Finally, switch off your phone. Your yoga practice is &#8216;you&#8217; time and for an hour or however long the duration of your class everything else can wait. It is also the most annoying thing in the world hearing a phone beep or vibrate. Think about others and just have a bit of respect. It&#8217;s zen time and all that jazz.</p>
<p><strong>What to  bring</strong></p>
<p>Most yoga studios will have the essentials you need for a class. It is worth checking out beforehand if the studio or teacher provide mats. If mats are not available, you may need to bring your own mat or sometimes you can rent them for a small fee. </p>
<p>I am a bit of a hygiene freak and I have attended some classes where the mats available are pretty grotty. One studio I went to insisted they cleaned their mats but they never did &#8211; and this was a place that offered hot yoga! Pretty grim. </p>
<p>To protect yourself from this, you can purchase a yoga towel to go on top of your mat. There is a fab selection on Amazon and places like Target and all the popular yoga brands sell them. The first one I bought was really cheap because I just wanted something to go over the mats I was using at the studio, but just like anything you can spend a little or a lot. If you fancy yourself as a dab hand with a needle, you can always sew small pieces of elastic at the corners of the towel so you can loop them over the corners of the mat so in class the towel won&#8217;t move too much when you are moving through the poses.</p>
<p>A smaller second towel is worth taking with you. Depending on the class you can get rather sweaty, so I like to take an additional towel where I can mop my brow. For slower classes, like restorative or yin yoga you probably won&#8217;t need a second towel but I like to take one anyway.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water.jpg" alt="mat sports bra towel water bottle" width="1200" height="212" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water-800x141.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mat-sportsbra-towel-water-300x53.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>If you want to go the whole hog and buy your own mat, again yoga mats can be as cheap or as expensive as you can imagine. Like most things you do get what you pay for, but for a beginner I wouldn&#8217;t recommend spending a fortune. You want something reasonable but at the same time unless you are going to commit to practising regularly it really isn&#8217;t worth spending a lot of money.</p>
<p>Purchasing a mat requires a blog post in its own right which I will do at some point, but for now there are just a few tips I would mention if you do decide to buy your own mat. It is a very personal choice. I always look for mats that are non slip because I tend to sweat a lot and I also have a yoga mat for when I am travelling that won&#8217;t take up too much space in my suitcase. After all, I need that space for shoes!</p>
<p>If you have any discomfort in your knees buy a slightly thicker mat. You can also fold your mat to provide extra padding for your knees and sometimes studios have blankets you can use.</p>
<p>If you use props in your class then more often than not they will be provided. I always like to use a block and a strap as they facilitate alignment and allow you to open up in many of the poses, but the studio should have these available. If you later want to develop your practice in your own time you can buy blocks and straps for a really reasonable price.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-145" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-pose-corpse-pose-300x225.jpg" alt="yoga pose savasana corpse sida yoga" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-pose-corpse-pose-300x225.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/yoga-pose-corpse-pose.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Also worth adding to your yoga kit bag is a hoody or a sweater. At the end of a class, students will be guided by the teacher into Savasana or Corpse pose. Savasana is the most important part to any practice and is a chance for your body to wind down after all that stretching, but you can get a tad chilly. Sometimes there are blankets at the studio but I always take a sweater with me and sometimes a pair of socks. You want to be able to rest in this pose, calm the mind and relax. You don&#8217;t want to be thinking the entire time &#8216;brrrrrrrrrrrr&#8217;.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you take a bottle or flask of water with you. Some yoga teachers are not keen on you drinking during a class but I always like to have fluids with me and stay hydrated. I used to get terrible headaches from dehydration because I never drank enough water before class. This is so important and common sense really but very easy to get wrong. </p>
<p><strong>Checklist</strong></p>
<p>To summarise and save you reading through this post all over again, here is my checklist for what tends to go in my yoga kit bag. The fact of the matter is, the more classes you try and the more yoga becomes part of your lifestyle you will buy more stuff and probably spend extra cash doing so. I had to buy a massive trunk to keep my kit tidy as my yoga room was starting to look like a warehouse. I own bolsters, EZ sliders (absolutely great for training the core on carpet), blocks, straps, blankets, foam rollers, stretch bands to name a few. I am also hoping that the birthday fairy brings me a Yoga Dharma wheel to add to my ever growing collection.</p>
<p>As you can see, it is easy to get a tad carried away. You may want to add extra items to your kit list as you attend more classes and realise what you need and what you don&#8217;t need, after all its <em>your </em>kit but this is what I usually pack:</p>
<ol>
<li><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-135" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-276x300.jpg" alt="mat towel manduka bag calvin klein pants yoga top sports bra block strap socks hoody headband water" width="276" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-276x300.jpg 276w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-800x869.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2-1105x1200.jpg 1105w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kitbag2.jpg 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" />Yoga Mat</li>
<li>Yoga Towel</li>
<li>Smaller towel</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Hoody</li>
<li>Socks</li>
<li>Headband (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga strap (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga block (optional)</li>
<li>Yoga bag</li>
<li>Sports bra, top and pants</li>
</ol>
<p>Above everything, enjoy yourselves. Before my first class I was nervous too, but the feeling I had after using muscles I never knew existed and being able to do far more of the poses I ever thought possible was amazing. I felt content, relaxed and deliciously stretched &#8211; a feeling that has stayed with me since my yoga journey began.</p>
