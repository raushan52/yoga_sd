<p>How do you develop  a consistent yoga practice at home?</p>
<p>We are certainly living in extraordinary times right now. Every single one of us has had to adapt to a new temporary way of life as we try and stay safe during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-coronovirus-stay-at-home-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Many of my students work for the NHS. When I catch myself in a grump, frustrated that I can’t see friends for a cheeky vino or attend a family BBQ, I think of them. Staying home really is a small ask in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my life is pretty well-equipped to deal with self-isolation. I don’t have children so no need to don my teacher’s hat. Working from home for me is normal and my yoga practice is 98% a home practice. I enjoy solitary walks outside and so far I’m enjoying my partner being at home all the time. I do miss my family and friends though. That makes my heart hurt a bit. Thank goodness for Zoom and House Party.</p>
<p>Many have used this time to get those jobs ticked off the ‘to-do’ list, improve their homes, unleash their creativity, learn a musical instrument or even learn a language.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/blog-things-to-do-during-coronavirus-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>While I applaud that motivation with as much vivacity as my <a href="https://clapforourcarers.co.uk">8pm applause</a> on Thursdays, I can’t help but feel this is all a bit ‘New Years’ Resolutiony’ for the rest of us.</p>
<p>These are strange times and for many, the days can roll into one, routine can be challenging and #selfisolation goals can make us feel even worse if <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/2020/01/to-quit-or-not-to-quit/">we don’t accomplish them</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need some reassurance, and perhaps that reassurance needs to be a little more helpful than ‘you are not alone’. You do not need to conquer the world right now.</p>
<p>Use this time to connect…to yourself.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to start a home yoga practice, or a time you needed it more.</p>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/shop"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-practice-blog-online-yoga-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>With more online yoga than ever before, you don’t have to look far to find live classes. Every day you can find something from all of your favourite teachers. But even this can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>We have put together a few ways to help you get started with a home practice. Take this opportunity to focus on your well-being, boost your motivation and perhaps find some peace in all this craziness.</p>
<h3><strong>Do Not Disturb</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1043 " src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="279" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-218x300.jpg 218w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-873x1200.jpg 873w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb-800x1100.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/do-not-disturb.jpg 945w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" />Make sure that you create a space for your practice where you will not be disturbed. Treat this time, similar to if you were about to take a long, relaxing soak in the tub.</p>
<p>Even though you are practising in your own home, you need to imagine you are attending your usual class. I think this is where most people struggle with a home practice.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to check your phone and get distracted because the environment isn’t set up for you to get your zen on. Usually everywhere we look in our homes, there is something (or someone) that requires our attention.</p>
<p>As best you can, try and set up a small space of tranquility. This is you time, and you want to be able to create the most authentic yoga space you can.</p>
<h3><strong>Make time</strong></h3>
<p>So many <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/shop/">online schedules</a> are available right now, which makes it alot easier to work into your schedule. Apply the same mindset to <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">on-demand courses</a>. Just because it isn&#8217;t live, you still need to consciously set time aside to do it. Pop a slot in the diary and make that extra effort to incorporate the classes into your daily routine.</p>
<p>It is important you approach online classes with the same attitude as an ‘in person’ class. This really works for me and helps keep my motivation.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1047" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-300x201.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1200x803.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920-800x535.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/day-planner-828611_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you are working from home, it can be all too easy to fall into the same pattern. Working through lunch breaks and pattering away at your keyboard for more hours than you should. You still need to take time out and have the breaks that you would normally when working in an office.</p>
<p>Taking an online class will also help to break up the monotony of the day. At the moment, it can feel like each day rolls into the next. Whether you schedule in a live class or a pre-recorded session, both are fantastic opportunities to create variety to ‘samey’ days.</p>
<p>I like to do my practice a couple of hours after my breakfast, and then after some admin and email checking, I’m ready for something yummy for lunch and then I power through work until dinner. For me, that schedule works really well for my routine and allows me to be motivated throughout the day and be more productive. Make a commitment and then the next time you set a time for your practice it will be even easier to stick to.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove any expectations</strong></h3>
<p>So you didn’t do a full 90 minute class and when you did, your online food delivery arrived and the postman called. The kids need your attention and the office has scheduled a Skype call over lunch. So what? Beating yourself up about it isn’t going to make you feel any better.</p>
<p>Life happens. Distractions happen.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1052 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/virtual-yoga-classes-sida-yoga-6jpg-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The intention to show up on your mat and make the time is a massive deal.  Just a few minutes in Child’s Pose (Balasana) or even taking 5 minutes in a seated meditation can be enough to reconnect.</p>
<p>When the day runs away from me and I haven’t done anything, you can usually find me on my mat in a supported Fish pose. I personally hold a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders, so this posture works wonders for me when time is short.</p>
<p>Find a pose that helps you relax and open up the body. There is always tomorrow for a Power Rocket class.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep it simple</strong></h3>
<p>This kind of follows on from the point above.</p>
<p>You don’t need a complicated yoga schedule right now. What would you like to work on to improve your practice?</p>
<p>I have one lovely student who keeps requesting hip openers for virtual classes. Usually, I would be like, sweets come on you gotta mix things up a bit! For now, I refrain from suggesting anything of the sort. That&#8217;s what makes her feel good right now, then who am I to tell her she should be doing backbends. Indulge in something that will help you rock up on your mat &#8211; even if it is hip opener after hip opener. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-938 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg" alt="Pyjama Yoga Online Classes Sida Yoga Evening Relaxation Calm Meditation Namaste StayAtHome" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1152160897-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Perhaps you want to take more time to relax, or maybe you would like to try a new style of yoga.</p>
<p>I’ve recently enjoyed discovering new styles myself thanks to virtual yoga. This is a great time to try something new. However, it is easy to get overwhelmed with choices. Try not to set yourself an impossible to-do list of yoga classes. Hone in on what you want from a practice. For me, I love alignment so Anusara is a good fit. I&#8217;ve always fancied having a go at Rocket yoga, and virtual classes have made these new styles possible to try. </p>
<p>Figure out what you want from your home practice and find the programs to suit your personal goals and requirements. That way, you aren’t just doing a class because you feel you have to. You are literally following the path of self improvement and that will make you feel so much better inside and out.</p>
<h3><strong>Join an online class or find a course</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-652 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/awolblog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>Use this opportunity to connect with your favourite teachers. I have been fortunate enough to practise yoga in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, China, USA and more&#8230; I&#8217;ve found wonderful teachers who I always make the effort to see whenever I am in the country. Today I can connect with every single one of them thanks to virtual classes, which is something I am very grateful for.</p>
<p>As I connect more with yogi friends I have met all over the world, I’m finding the virtual support and shares really fantastic.</p>
<p>I’ve actually really enjoyed teaching online and will probably continue some of the classes when the self isolation rules are lifted.</p>
<p>For me it’s been a lovely way to connect with my students and I’ve enjoyed the challenge of finding simpler alignment cues that don’t necessarily need me to be there in person. As a teacher it’s been more physically demanding as well – particularly with the stronger vinyasa classes.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t a substitute for actual interaction with a person. However, the current situation has actually been a really special learning experience. For me, it’s much more efficient to use these times as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than wither and wallow. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>If all else fails, shake your booty</strong></h3>
<figure id="attachment_1059" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1059" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1059 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-1162624131-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1059" class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<p>So your brand new yoga mat is still in its packaging. Your new #workoutathome yoga pants still have the labels attached. The online yoga course you bought still hasn&#8217;t been used and you are ready to give up.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter. It really doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Put on those fabulous new star print yoga leggings and shake that cute booty while you make a cup of tea. Laugh at yourself.</p>
<p>Ask Alexa to play your favourite track and dance like no one is watching. I promise it will make you feel better.</p>
<p>Yoga isn&#8217;t going anywhere and you don&#8217;t have to conquer the world right now. All you need to do to be a superhero is stay at home. </p>
<p>Peace and love yogis xox</p>
<p> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you experienced any negative side effects to your yoga practice?</p>
<p>Eh? What? A downside to yoga? Vic, what are you talking about? Hang up your mat and get out of town! Immediately.</p>
<p>Before I lose all credibility, side note necessary. Yoga is AWESOME and is by far the best thing I chose to do with my life. From the wisdom and golden nuggets gleaned from others, to the turbulent path of postures ranging in difficulty (massively), for me the result has been one of deeper self-awareness, power and happiness.</p>

However, it’s not all green meadows, faeries and inner peace. Like with everything (sadly) there are downsides too. If life were fair chocolate would be calorie-free and red wine would be a superfood (although I am pretty sure I read <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191021-is-wine-good-for-you">somewhere</a> it was good for you?). This post is intended to be a playful tongue-in-cheek view of the negative consequences of a regular yoga practice.</p>
<p>I adore yoga and practise every single day (give or take the odd hangover). My <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">practice</a> is varied but I focus heavily on my core and building strength. I also love my <a href="https://www.onepeloton.co.uk">Peloton</a> bike and will do a session at least three times a week. My body and lifestyle have both changed quite dramatically and while I am happy with the transformation, there are some side effects that might not be so desirable:</p>
<h3><strong>Your body changes</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear how those who shed the pounds get the ultimate satisfaction when they go shopping for clothes in a smaller size. It makes all the dieting and exercise totally worth it.</p>
<p>Well my yoga routine has changed my body significantly and not in the way I expected. My boobs have shrunk (sob) and my arms are musclier, meaning I can no longer find anything with sleeves that fits. It&#8217;s either too small in the arm and fits everywhere else, or fits my arms and drowns me. My favourite sleeved dress is now the worst thing I own and kept for Hulk impressions only (at least Halloween is sorted).</p>
<p>Replacing all my bras was also rather costly. Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.victoriassecret.co.uk">Victoria Secret</a> sales!</p>
<p>Now the reality of the situation is I LOVE my body which is something that has taken at least 25 years to say. No doubt that might change when the crow’s feet get deeper but for now I truly love the skin I am in. Whether that’s down to yoga or maturity I can’t be sure, but either way I&#8217;ve come a long way from the teen anorexic who hated everything they saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>What is different, is I FEEL great – which is the key to being happy about how you look I think. So what if it means I have to buy new clothes to accommodate my changing figure? It really is a small price to pay when on the inside I feel so awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg" alt="body-measurment-body-transformation" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/body-measurement-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You sweat more</strong></h3>
<p>If you like Hot yoga, Vinyasa or anything that gets your heart rate going you will sweat pretty much every time you show up to class. </p>
<p>At my old studio in China, I was doing Hot Yoga every other day and if I didn’t bring my yoga towel, my mat was like a Slip N Slide.</p>
<p>In the summer I can often have 4 showers a day especially on my busy teaching days. I’ve had to invest in a more robust deodorant to keep up with the pace.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the laundry. Oh my goodness the laundry. In order to stay clean and fresh for classes, my hallway looks like I moonlight as Widow Twankey! </p>
<p>And then there is the multiple trips to the bathroom. I now drink way more water than I used to and seem to shower all the time. I put my skin and hair through a lot, using way more products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-789" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sweat-shower-toilet-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><strong>You live in activewear</strong></h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-792 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg" alt="trendy, yoga, sportswear, activewear" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iStock-950345634-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>My wardrobe is full of colourful prints, beautiful dresses and fabulous shoes….OH the shoes. However, the reality is I only ever seem to wear my yoga gear.</p>
<p>While my ironing pile is practically non-existent, I sometimes resent that my everyday wear is super casual.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong – I LOVE my activewear, but like anything, yoga clothes can get boring, fast.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be more expensive</strong></h3>
<p>The more you get sucked into the world of yoga, the chances are the more cash you will spend.<br />
When I started, I bought my workout gear from Decathlon including a £5 yoga mat which I was perfectly happy with. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-797" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1804-300x225.jpg" alt="Liforme, yoga mat, manduka" width="300" height="225" />The more I practised, the more expensive my stuff got. I just wanted better quality in my kit. Liforme and Manduka mats retail over £100 and are now my go-to. This may sound like a leap, but I feel I get what I pay for. I practise every day and need a mat with good grip as well as one that is hard-wearing but that means more cash.</p>
<p>I invest in pieces I love to wear and that make me feel good. I can’t risk the dreaded see-through yoga pant and I want to wear clothes that I like. Comfort is also really important which means decent quality fabrics which are more expensive.</p>
<p>Of course how much you spend is up to you, but this is definitely a rabbit hole I fell down.</p>
<h3><strong>The DOMS</strong></h3>
<p>Otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, after a tough workout the DOMS may say hi. Those of you that have ever done a tough workout have experienced this in one form or another.</p>
<p>DOMS is the pain and stiffness you feel after exercise, which can occur about 24-48 hours after your workout session. After high-intensity exercise we create micro-tears in our muscles which sounds scary but it means they can recover, adapt and become even stronger.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or a top athlete, DOMS can affect anyone. Yoga often is calming and restorative, but  you may have a power practice. If you focus on a particular skill, like inversions or arm balancing, then your practice is likely to be strong. Lots of core and drill exercises, cue DOMS.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to like the feeling of DOMS though. I’ve learnt how to ease the soreness and I like the feeling of knowing I worked hard the previous day. If I feel particularly sore, I like to do something more restorative like a yin practice and I always feel better for it.</p>
<p>But for some people DOMS is a really crap consequence after exercise. It really can make you question how fair life is when you work your ass off only to find yourself struggling to walk the next day.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/doms-muscle-pain-injry-strip-blog-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></h3>
<h3><strong>You are more prone to injury</strong></h3>
<p>With a regular Vinyasa practice, there can be a higher chance of sustaining an injury. </p>
<p>If your alignment and self awareness isn&#8217;t there, repetitive movements (when done incorrectly) can cause damage to the body particularly postures that impact the wrists, shoulders or knees. Often we can &#8216;dump&#8217; into postures due to the body&#8217;s need to take the path of least resistance. This can put more strain on our joints and muscles and then before you know it, injury.</p>
<p>Sometimes injuries can happen when we lack self awareness and think we are ready for a deeper version of a posture and push ourselves before our body is ready. </p>
<p>I injured myself quite badly a few years ago and it was all because I thought I could do something that my body wasn&#8217;t warmed up for. This small lapse in judgement cost me big. Thankfully I am back to normal but I see the same mistakes made everyday. People often push themselves further than they should without listening to what their body is telling them. </p>
<p>Learning this lesson from the <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">start</a> is helpful, because as we practise more and more we have to be extra careful. Rule of thumb &#8211; if a posture feels painful and you can&#8217;t maintain even breathing, modify or come out.</p>
<p>So there you have it – the dark side of yoga. It’s not all smiles and rainbows you know. But in truth, it is. I don’t really care if I have to take a few extra showers, spend a bit more cash or deal with the odd sore set of muscles now and again.</p>
<p>I love yoga and I’m unlikely to be put off anytime soon even if sometimes the consequences of a regular practice are undesirable.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other down sides to yoga? I’d love to hear your thoughts, until next time yogis!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1071495136-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />As a yoga teacher I hear and see this all the time; &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not doing that&#8217; or &#8216;My legs/torso/arms/(insert other here) are too short/long&#8217;. Or, I get the quiet ones who just tend to look at me in horror waiting for the challenge to be over and we move on to something more accessible.</p>
<p>Unless you have an injury or a similar reason for not being able to do the posture or challenge, then I always expect my students to at least give it a go. &#8216;Just try&#8217; I say.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-735 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-848216056-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Sometimes students fall or lose balance and I smile and say &#8216;That&#8217;s awesome! That shows me you went for it&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t try, you will be forever stuck where you are, unable to progress and running away from challenges rather than facing them. I try to encourage my students to take what they learn on the mat, away with them off the mat. If what you learnt from your class that day was to stick your head in the stand and shy away from a posture then that&#8217;s not really what I want you to take away from my class. I want you to feel empowered, strong and wanting to do more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-745 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-290x300.png 290w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1158x1200.png 1158w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920-800x829.png 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/not-yet-1426593_1920.png 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></p>
<p>I also HATE the word &#8216;can&#8217;t&#8217; in an asana practice. Instead, I explain to my class&#8230;it&#8217;s just &#8216;not yet&#8217;. This is the mantra I try to repeat as often as possible to those students who just feel stuck and run away. I find this re-phrasing tends to resonate with people more than me putting my strict teacher face on. I like to give an example of something that they can do today that they couldn&#8217;t do before. The simplest example I can think of is walking. We cannot walk from birth, this is something we learn to do. It may take us 9 months to a year (or even longer) of falling on our backsides before we take our first steps, but it happens with time and patience, and it&#8217;s really as simple as that.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to asanas you currently find impossible to achieve. We live in a world where many of us want instant gratification and quite often, we don&#8217;t want to put in the hard work required to nail the posture. What&#8217;s even worse is when it can take years to make even the smallest shift to progress.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, some students can take the &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach. &#8216;I can&#8217;t get there right now so why bother?&#8217; </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-753 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fourpics-cant-wont1-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
It can feel disheartening when you can&#8217;t yet do something. Especially when the shape looks simple enough. It&#8217;s very easy to take the &#8216;can&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do&#8217; route, when I can guarantee there is a possible path to the posture that will work for you right now. Take the modifications and make use of props and yoga toys to make yourself feel supported in the posture. Find <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">tutorials online</a> to help give you ideas on how you can make a posture more accessible. </p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-749 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/iStock-1171447238-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Something that one of my favourite yogis <a href="https://www.elvisgarciayoga.com">Elvis Garcia</a> mentioned in one of his online classes I took years ago, still sticks with me today; &#8216;Any part of the pose is still the pose&#8217;. I absolutely LOVE this and it&#8217;s so so true. Let&#8217;s take the example of Bakasana (Crow pose). Even working on lifting your hips higher from Malasana pose while you plant the hands is still <em>part</em> of the pose. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the feet stay on the ground or not. We are training our bodies into the shape of the posture and working our muscle memory so we get one step closer to our goal. You can still engage the bandhas and find the correct protraction of the shoulders even with the feet firmly planted on the ground. Sitting on your butt and willing the moment to pass, <i>isn&#8217;t </i>part of the pose and you will never get there in a month of Sundays. If something is holding you back figure out what that is and work with it. Perhaps it&#8217;s a fear of falling in which case <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sidayoga/videos/1652540961451389/">pad the space around you</a> with as many pillows you can find, and then just fall. A soft landing with arm balances can really help take the fear out of the attempt, which might be the very thing holding you back.</p>
<p>I am a curvy girl with boobs and I&#8217;ve had teachers tell me some postures will never be in my repertoire. Well poo to that! Certain postures might not come as easy to me as others, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to give up. I&#8217;m going to work with the goods God gave me and make it work, and you know what &#8211; this hasn&#8217;t failed me yet.</p>
<p>Get out of your head. Just because thousands of people on Instagram can do that handstand you can&#8217;t quite nail yet, don&#8217;t be under any illusion. They probably had to work their a$$es off to get there. Strength drills, flexibility exercises, shoulder opening and dedication&#8230;every day. That famous yoga <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yogaeverydamnday/?hl=en">hashtag</a> exists for a reason!</p>
<p>And guys and gals please&#8230; there is NO SUCH THING AS CAN&#8217;T &#8211; just NOT YET!</p>
<p>Start thinking like Frodo and get your Fellowship together and start that long journey. Just like the Fellowship, you will have some serious hurdles to climb, and perhaps you will often feel like giving up, but commit yourself to the process. You won&#8217;t save Middle Earth, but I can guarantee you will feel incredible when you eventually realise the goals that you feel are impossible today. In fact, the longer the journey, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when you finally get to where you want to be.</p>
<p>Here is my advice on how to <del>save Middle Earth</del> get one step closer to your asana goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAKE THE MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teacher offers a variation to a challenging pose, try it. There is no requirement to shoot and score the pose the first try. Feel it out. Maybe grab your blocks and a strap and see how the props can help with the pose. Try not to rely on them too much, particularly in the example of using the wall for inversions &#8211; it&#8217;s very easy to get to a place where your best friend and crutch turns into something you rely on too much and again you can become stuck, or get used to incorrect alignment which can cause injury.</p>
<ul>
<li>LOOK AT THE INTENTION OF THE POSE</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-756 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/handstand-preop-with-block-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Is the posture one that opens up the shoulders? Or perhaps it&#8217;s completely focused on the core. In which case, take some time to practice drills that will build strength or open up the body in those areas. If you are even attempting arm balancing you should be warming up your wrists before you bear weight on your hands. Look at what the pose is asking from you and then do some extra homework to make the goal pose that little bit more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>MONITOR YOUR PROGRESS</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-757" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/yoga-pose-plank-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Progress may happen quickly or slowly but however long it takes, take the time to check in and look at how far you have come. Maybe you are managing a kick up handstand to the wall now, after starting at zero. Perhaps holding plank pose for those extra 10 seconds is alot more doable. This is all progress and looking at how far you have come gives you a good indication of how far you have to go and makes the end goal way more realistic. </p>
<ul>
<li>CELEBRATE SMALL VICTORIES</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanumanasana (full splits) for example takes time. You need open hip flexors and hamstrings and quite often these areas are a tight spot for many people, especially if you are an athlete. As the body gradually opens the more you practice, take a moment to celebrate every time you get closer and closer to the full posture. Celebrate and take joy in every miracle millimetre. It&#8217;s a good reminder that it&#8217;s the journey that matters not the destination.</p>

<p>That would be a hard…no. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>Over Christmas, I was bed-ridden with the flu. You know you have the flu if you spot a £50 note on the floor and simply don’t have the capacity to even think about picking it up. I spent most of my time in my pyjamas in bed feeling very sorry for myself. My body ached, my throat was coarse and my ears were beyond painful.</p>
<p>Two days into flu-gate and I really didn’t feel like I was getting any better despite the R&amp;R and polishing off the best part of a bottle of Benylin (or maybe it was 3 bottles!).</p>
<p>I was also getting increasingly frustrated that I couldn’t do my daily practice, but in truth even if I had managed to pull on my yoga pants I wouldn’t have gotten very far after that.</p>
<p>I of course cancelled all my classes but was certainly feeling the withdrawal symptoms of a physical personal practice.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-709 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-ill-woman-mediation-sick-poorly-800x533.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I finally did start feeling a bit better, I decided to roll out the mat and take it easy. Some restorative Yin and Yoga Nidra is just what the doctor ordered – only it really wasn’t. I wasn’t feeling nearly as bad as I had previously, but my nose was still blocked and my throat still sore, so forget any consistent breathing.</p>
<p>It felt just…..wrong. Being unable to breathe properly just made me feel really disconnected from my practice, and just rubbish.</p>
<p>I could just about manage a half decent Yoga Nidra practice but to be honest I think that was the medication. Sniffling and coughing your way through even the shortest of meditations just doesn’t have the desired effect and can often make you feel worse.</p>
<p>When you are ill you really need to think twice about attending your regular class.</p>
<p>This is the hardest thing for me when I am feeling unwell or if I am injured – stopping. My practice these days is so disciplined, I just cannot turn it off even if my body forces me to do so. Yes I am sick and yes everything hurts but the worst part is not being able to roll out my mat.</p>
<p>Yoga literally means ‘to yoke’ and to ‘unite’, and when we have a physical practice, a Pranayama practice or meditation session, if we cannot unite our breath with our movement and struggle with our inhales and exhales, then we really have an important ingredient missing from the entire process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-713" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gym-yoga-sweat-childpose-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
Yet still I have students that attend class when they feel under the weather and even have clients who will still keep their private appointment despite coughing and spluttering the moment I arrive. My group classes are particularly physical, so this really is a bad move if you are not feeling 100%.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-715" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-300x239.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1200x955.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-1536x1222.jpg 1536w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont-800x637.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/no-emoji-dont.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I’ve had sick students dash out of the room to grab tissues and don’t even get me started on the consequences of Nadi Shodhana on a poorly students’ nasal passages !(gross emoji?)</p>
<p>When you cannot breathe you cannot unite your breath with your movement and your practice then isn’t yoga anymore, it is something else, something more forced and strained and well, unpleasant.</p>
<p>Even if you try a restorative class or a meditation class, our bodies feel heavy and achy, and our minds clouded when we are ill, and quite often you can leave a class feeling worse than before which is the exact opposite of what we are aiming for when we practice yoga.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the reality is, you are full of germs. Think of other people in the class, while we all like to spread the love in our practice that doesn’t extend to your lurgy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="338" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-300x85.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-virus-germs-sick-bacteria-800x225.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
In gym environments with air conditioning or heated yoga studios this is an environment where germs spread and multiply. Your teacher doesn’t want to catch a cold and neither do your fellow students. When you feel a cold coming on, consider others and skip practice. Respect one another.</p>
<p>I once attended a studio where students were politely asked to leave if they were unwell – and I was really grateful for that rule. As I am my own boss I lose income if I am sick so I try to be extra cautious and while I am sure the sick student wasn’t thrilled at being turned away from class, I was pleased that the studio looked out for its members and teachers. After all they also lose money if they have to cancel a class owing to a teacher being ill. Of course it’s not all about money but it’s most definitely a factor here and it can be frustrating if occasional bouts of illness could be avoided if people were a little more considerate.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-721 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-281x300.jpg 281w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1126x1200.jpg 1126w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-1441x1536.jpg 1441w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga-800x853.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bks-iyenagr-light-on-yoga.jpg 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" />B.K.S Iyengar recommends a number of asanas to try when experiencing a variety of different ailments and diseases in his book; <em>Light on Yoga.</em> This handy appendix has often been my go-to when I get students come to me with various issues and problems, but these prescribed asanas do not extend to flu or colds.</p>
<p>If we were supposed to practice asana when full of flu I can’t help but feel Iyengar would have included them in his yoga bible.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor by any stretch but when you are ill, this is your body’s way of telling you to rest and you need to focus on getting better rather than pushing yourself into a practice that could do more damage than good and even prolong the time it takes for you to get better. It’s just common sense.</p>
<p>Hydrate by drinking lots of fluids and consult your pharmacist for some good over-the-counter medication before resorting to anti-biotics. I personally swear by lemon, honey and ginger, herbal teas and Echinacea as well as my trusty bottle of Benylin (always read the label). First thing’s first – look after yourself with a lot of rest.</p>
<p>An extra intake of Vitamin C won’t do you any harm either, so make sure you have some good juice in the fridge and perhaps some multi-vitamins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-300x50.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flu-treatment-herbal-remedy-echinacea-800x133.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><br />
When you start feeling a bit better, there is nothing stopping you trying some gentle postures in the comfort of your own home. There are some awesome yoga classes <a href="https://www.sidayoga.com/classes/on-demand/">available online</a> as well. See how it feels, but be truthful with yourself at the same time. Just because you are rushing to get back to the mat, put yourself first. An advanced practice is about self- awareness and honesty. For me, a good rule of thumb is that the postures should feel good – nothing more complicated than that. If you are wishing time away and just doing it for the sake of doing it because you would feel guilty otherwise then you are wasting your time on the mat and you need to take it down a notch.</p>
<p>Relish in the experience of winding down and give yourself some self-love. Yoga isn’t going anywhere &#8211; so don’t rush the recovery process and in no time at all you will be fighting fit.</p>
<p>In the meantime – Get well soon yogi!</p>
<p>Namaste</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga can be really intimidating for some people, then add in the fact that you might burst into tears during a class and it&#8217;s not surprising many people are put off. </p>
<p>I am talking about emotions and yoga. This takes me back to a workshop I attended a few years ago when I was living in Shanghai. During the class I remember a Pranayama (breathing) exercise and I could hear someone in the class sniffling. My first thought was the poor girl was probably struggling with a nasty cold and blocked up nose, but it wasn&#8217;t until the end of the class when we were all chatting did she mention that she had in fact been crying and couldn&#8217;t stop. The yoga workshop itself had actually brought her emotions to the surface and once they were there she couldn&#8217;t stop them. It turned out she had actually recently broken up with her boyfriend and quite openly told us that she hadn&#8217;t really been dealing with it emotionally. That &#8216;Keep Calm and Carry On&#8217; attitude seemed to infiltrate her system and before she knew it she hadn&#8217;t even cried about it &#8211; until now.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-227 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg" alt="emoji, emotions, happy, sad, afraid, prayer, confused" width="1200" height="164" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-800x109.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-300x41.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />This was the first time I had ever seen anyone get &#8216;upset&#8217; during a yoga class and I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t the teeniest bit jealous. You might say I had a touch of &#8216;FOMO&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Fear Of Missing Out&#8217;. I know this sounds bizarre and the very thought of crying in public is not something I would ever want to do in a hurry but I wondered what it would be like to have that level of connection and a part of me felt like I must be doing something wrong if I didn&#8217;t have that in my practice.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t realise was that I did already have that in my practice. While I wasn&#8217;t crying I would sometimes have feelings of anger, frustration, happiness or fear to name just a few. I was still experiencing emotion only they were personal to me. These feelings made total sense to how I was feeling at the time. I am an open person when it comes to discussing anything painful or upsetting but when it comes to other emotions I do tend to have a habit of shutting them out.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-226 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg" alt="supported-balasana-childs--pose-restorative-yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Quite recently, I experienced one of my students getting emotional during one of my Restorative Yoga classes for the very first time. We were in a supported <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> which is a beautiful pose for opening up the lower back and massaging the abdominal organs. It is also a great pose to do to connect to the breath. I had only really seen students get emotional during intense hip openers so for me this was quite new. As a teacher it is very important that the students feel that they are in a supportive environment and not at all embarrassed about anything they might be experiencing. My lovely student was a very open person and wanted to speak to me about it. For her, <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> brought back vivid memories of how she used to lie with her ex husband and understandably this was a very emotional experience for her, particularly when we hold restorative poses for as long as 10-15 minutes sometimes. I was very proud of my student. She felt comfortable enough to share that part of her life with me, but it also showed me how any pose can trigger memories or stir up something inside of us and she was so focused on the class that her emotions came right to the surface.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-230 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg" alt="distractions, tv, facebook, phone" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />When we go to a yoga class we spend that time completely focused on ourselves. No outside distractions of our phones, television, work or social media. If we allow ourselves to become completely devoted to that time on the mat, our awareness is increased and it is possible to feel things we usually ignore. If you look at it another way it has the potential to be free therapy. A path where we can completely feel how we want to feel without any judgement or criticism. </p>
<p>I can understand completely why this might put people off from trying a class. Yoga by its very nature forces you to feel your emotions no matter how hard you push them down and for many people this can be a very unappealing prospect. The UK is very much associated with the phrase &#8216;stiff upper lip&#8217; where great restraint is shown when it comes to expressing your feelings. I also found this to be the case when I was living in China where public emotion was quite rare.</p>
<p>Surely then what presents itself is an opportunity? A chance to have an experience without being directly in control of it. Scary for all those control freaks out there (including myself) but what&#8217;s the worse that can happen? So a few tears might roll out during the third minute of Pigeon pose so what? Your yoga practice is about you being in the here and now and by actively working to release tension this can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>When we come to class no one is feeling exactly the same so we begin our practice from very different positions emotionally speaking. The person to your left may have just had an argument with his girlfriend, the lady to your right may have just lost her cat or the person in front of you may have just won the lottery. Their starting point is different from yours and what will come to the surface will vary from student to student.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-233 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg" alt="yoga, zen, sida yoga, " width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Your mind, body and spirit are united and what happens to one happens to another. A yoga class that is well sequenced and well balanced will push you to your mindful limits and with outside distractions temporarily shelved a release is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>The physical sensations of the asanas will twist and bend anything that is stored up in our bodies &#8211; kind of like wringing out a wet towel. Moving and breathing creates more space allowing the energy to move more freely &#8211; almost like a mindful detox. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a quick process, the key to unlocking your emotions takes time if you are open to doing so. Be curious about what you are feeling during your practice. It can be absolutely fascinating as well as healing. Don&#8217;t be put off about the possibility of shedding a tear or two it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Accept yourself and remember that it is perfectly normal to feel however you feel and there is nothing embarrassing about that. </p>
<p>I have included a few poses here to help with emotional connection, so if the prospect of a busy class doesn&#8217;t quite appeal just yet, you can do these poses in the comfort and privacy of your own home and not be at all worried what may come to the surface. Enjoy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Sun Salutations</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-235" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg" alt="sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Begin by doing a few rounds of <em>Surya Namaskara (sun salutations)</em> to warm up the body.</p>
<p>The forward folds during this short sequence will loosen the hamstrings. Forward folds are linked to letting go of anything negative or stressful you are holding on to &#8211; in particular any feelings of worry or concern. If you are new to sun salutations the diagram to the left shows the different steps. Remember to move while following the breath to get the full benefit of the sequence.</p>
<p>During this warm up, take the time to hold the forward folds for a couple of extra breaths and allow the release of any tightness in the hamstrings &#8211; just let go. </p>
<p><strong>Lizard Pose and Pigeon</strong></p>
<p>Both of these poses are deep stretches for the hips, hamstrings and thighs and help to relax and calm the mind. If you have a knee or hip inflammation you may want to avoid this pose.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-237" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="lizard, pose, sidayoga, yoga, utahan pristhasana" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For<em> Utthan Pristhasana (Lizard Pose)</em> start in Downward Dog, exhale and step the right foot in between the hands making sure that your knee is directly above the ankle. Lower your left knee to the mat. If you have any discomfort in your knee you can either fold your mat to make a more padded surface or use a folded towel or blanket. Move your right foot to the right a few inches and bring your elbows down to the floor inside the right leg on an exhale. If you are having difficulty, place your elbows on a block or remain up on your hands. For a deeper challenge tuck the back toes under and lift the left knee off the floor straightening the leg and extending through the heel. Stay here for 5-10 breaths and then switch sides.</p>
<p>Our hips store emotions such as anger, sadness and frustration and are often tight because we tend to hold on to these feelings. To soften this tightness try softening into the pose. Do not to clench and try to allow yourself to relax and breathe into the sensations. This pose also helps to release tension in the lower back and I have to admit is one of my favourites.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-238" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="pigeon, fold forward, aka raja kapotasana" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For <em>Eka Pada Raja Kapotasana (Pigeon Pose)</em> begin in Downward Dog and lift the right leg and then on an exhale, bring the right knee to the back of your right wrist and place the shin on the front of the mat. How parallel your shin is to the front of your mat will depend on how open your hips are and how deep you want to go.</p>
<p>The further the heel from the groin the more intense the pose. Extend the left leg behind you and lower your hips to the floor. Keep the right foot flexed to protect the knee. Inhale and press your hands to the floor send your tailbone down and the crown of your head up to the ceiling and lift out of the lower back.</p>
<p>To go deeper, exhale and slowly walk your hands forward to a fold as shown in the picture. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable. I have been known to stay here in my Yin practice for at least five minutes but 5-10 breaths is a great starting point. To come out of the pose inhale and slowly walk the hands back to come up, gently lean towards the right hip as you bring the right leg to the front and give your legs a little shake before repeating on the other side. If this pose is too intense, try using a folded blanket or block underneath the hip on the side where the leg is bent as this will add support.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Forward Fold and Double Seated Pigeon/Fire Log Pose</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-240" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg" alt="dandasana, staff pose, yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />After finishing Pigeon Pose on the left side your legs should be out in front of you after you have given them a little shake after the intensity of the deep stretching. Take a moment in <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>to centre yourself. Feel grounded in the sit bones and try not to slump the body. Sit as straight as possible using the core muscles, press the hands into the floor and reach the crown of the head to the ceiling. Hold for a few breaths. This isn&#8217;t a relaxing pose and does take a fair amount of core strength to sit up straight and not slouch.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-241" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="paschimottanasana, seated, forward, fold" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Then, when you are ready, on an inhale raise your arms overhead and on an exhale hinge forward from the hips and take a hold of the big toes. Inhale and lengthen the spine and exhale and fold deeper to wherever is comfortable. This is your <em>Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Fold)</em>. You may grab your shins, ankles or toes or use a strap to help with the lengthening of the spine. This pose is great for the lower back muscles and also stretches the hamstrings. Surrender to any feelings of worry and allow yourself to reap the benefits of this truly wonderful pose. To go deeper and if you are really flexible, you can use a yoga block placed in front of the feet and instead of grabbing the foot you can grab the yoga block, but make sure you maintain the integrity of the pose. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable and when you are ready inhale to come back to <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose).</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-242" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="agnistambhasana, yoga, sida yta, fire log pose" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Next come to Double Seated Pigeon Pose also known as <em>Agnistambhasana (Fire Log Pose)</em>. From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>place your right foot on top of the left knee and move your left foot so it is just below your right knee and keep both feet flexed. This is a deep hip opener and can already feel too much of a challenge. If you are feeling any discomfort just stay with the legs crossed and you can also use a yoga block or folded blanket underneath your hips. Press the fingertips down and inhale to expand the chest then walk the hands coming to a forward fold. Listen to your body and do not go deeper beyond your limit. Stay here for as long as possible and then repeat on the other side with the left foot on top of the right knee and the right foot underneath the left knee.</p>
<p><b>Half Spinal Twist</b></p>
<p>After Fire Log pose take a moment to take the feet to the width of the mat and gently move the knees from side to side much like a wiper blade action. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-243" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg" alt="half, spinal twist, arch, matsyendrasana, sida yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We now come to <em>Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Spinal Twist). </em>Feel free to take your favourite twist here.  Twisting is great for digestion but also brings the focus to the liver. The liver cleans the blood and stores energy but is also linked to emotions of anger. By twisting, this action of wringing out a wet towel also squeezes and massages away anger.</p>
<p>From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>bend your right leg and place the right foot on the floor outside your left knee or thigh. Place the left fingertips on the floor behind you, inhale and reach the left arm up while lengthening the spine. Exhale and bring the left elbow against the outside of your right knee. Inhale and lengthen the spine, exhale and twist turning the abdomen, ribs and chest whilst still keeping the length in the spine. There should be no tension in the shoulders and keep grounding through the sit bones. Remember lengthen on the inhalation, twist deeper on the exhalation. Stay here for 5-10 breaths, release in reverse order, head, shoulders and then abdomen to the front of the space, then repeat on the other side. If you find that your back rounds in this pose, place a blanket underneath your hips. You can also hug the knee rather than placing the elbow on the outside of the knee if the original twist is too intense.</p>
<p>There are of course other poses you can try to help find your emotional connection. You may want to try the Finishing Sequence from the Ashtanga Primary Series. Only attempt this if you are familiar with the sequence or you can try a modified version of each of the poses.</p>
<p>Back bends open the heart and give us energy and courage, while inversions allow us to see the world upside down offering us a different perspective and insight &#8211; a great way to purify the mind and and help calm us when life can be too much sometimes. In my own experience with inversions, I have found them to be extremely overwhelming emotionally. At first I had fear, terrified of falling flat on my face, but then I felt empowered at my ability to balance on a part of my body that was something other than my feet. A great way to build confidence if you just keep practising. Remember, it&#8217;s all about the journey not the destination <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
