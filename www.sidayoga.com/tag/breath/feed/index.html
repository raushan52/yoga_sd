								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga can be really intimidating for some people, then add in the fact that you might burst into tears during a class and it&#8217;s not surprising many people are put off. </p>
<p>I am talking about emotions and yoga. This takes me back to a workshop I attended a few years ago when I was living in Shanghai. During the class I remember a Pranayama (breathing) exercise and I could hear someone in the class sniffling. My first thought was the poor girl was probably struggling with a nasty cold and blocked up nose, but it wasn&#8217;t until the end of the class when we were all chatting did she mention that she had in fact been crying and couldn&#8217;t stop. The yoga workshop itself had actually brought her emotions to the surface and once they were there she couldn&#8217;t stop them. It turned out she had actually recently broken up with her boyfriend and quite openly told us that she hadn&#8217;t really been dealing with it emotionally. That &#8216;Keep Calm and Carry On&#8217; attitude seemed to infiltrate her system and before she knew it she hadn&#8217;t even cried about it &#8211; until now.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-227 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg" alt="emoji, emotions, happy, sad, afraid, prayer, confused" width="1200" height="164" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-800x109.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emojis-300x41.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />This was the first time I had ever seen anyone get &#8216;upset&#8217; during a yoga class and I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t the teeniest bit jealous. You might say I had a touch of &#8216;FOMO&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Fear Of Missing Out&#8217;. I know this sounds bizarre and the very thought of crying in public is not something I would ever want to do in a hurry but I wondered what it would be like to have that level of connection and a part of me felt like I must be doing something wrong if I didn&#8217;t have that in my practice.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t realise was that I did already have that in my practice. While I wasn&#8217;t crying I would sometimes have feelings of anger, frustration, happiness or fear to name just a few. I was still experiencing emotion only they were personal to me. These feelings made total sense to how I was feeling at the time. I am an open person when it comes to discussing anything painful or upsetting but when it comes to other emotions I do tend to have a habit of shutting them out.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-226 size-medium" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg" alt="supported-balasana-childs--pose-restorative-yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/supported-balasana-childs-pose-restorative-yoga-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Quite recently, I experienced one of my students getting emotional during one of my Restorative Yoga classes for the very first time. We were in a supported <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> which is a beautiful pose for opening up the lower back and massaging the abdominal organs. It is also a great pose to do to connect to the breath. I had only really seen students get emotional during intense hip openers so for me this was quite new. As a teacher it is very important that the students feel that they are in a supportive environment and not at all embarrassed about anything they might be experiencing. My lovely student was a very open person and wanted to speak to me about it. For her, <em>Balasana (Child&#8217;s Pose)</em> brought back vivid memories of how she used to lie with her ex husband and understandably this was a very emotional experience for her, particularly when we hold restorative poses for as long as 10-15 minutes sometimes. I was very proud of my student. She felt comfortable enough to share that part of her life with me, but it also showed me how any pose can trigger memories or stir up something inside of us and she was so focused on the class that her emotions came right to the surface.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-230 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg" alt="distractions, tv, facebook, phone" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/distractions-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />When we go to a yoga class we spend that time completely focused on ourselves. No outside distractions of our phones, television, work or social media. If we allow ourselves to become completely devoted to that time on the mat, our awareness is increased and it is possible to feel things we usually ignore. If you look at it another way it has the potential to be free therapy. A path where we can completely feel how we want to feel without any judgement or criticism. </p>
<p>I can understand completely why this might put people off from trying a class. Yoga by its very nature forces you to feel your emotions no matter how hard you push them down and for many people this can be a very unappealing prospect. The UK is very much associated with the phrase &#8216;stiff upper lip&#8217; where great restraint is shown when it comes to expressing your feelings. I also found this to be the case when I was living in China where public emotion was quite rare.</p>
<p>Surely then what presents itself is an opportunity? A chance to have an experience without being directly in control of it. Scary for all those control freaks out there (including myself) but what&#8217;s the worse that can happen? So a few tears might roll out during the third minute of Pigeon pose so what? Your yoga practice is about you being in the here and now and by actively working to release tension this can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>When we come to class no one is feeling exactly the same so we begin our practice from very different positions emotionally speaking. The person to your left may have just had an argument with his girlfriend, the lady to your right may have just lost her cat or the person in front of you may have just won the lottery. Their starting point is different from yours and what will come to the surface will vary from student to student.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-233 size-full" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg" alt="yoga, zen, sida yoga, " width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-800x133.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yoga-zen-300x50.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Your mind, body and spirit are united and what happens to one happens to another. A yoga class that is well sequenced and well balanced will push you to your mindful limits and with outside distractions temporarily shelved a release is perfectly normal.</p>
<p>The physical sensations of the asanas will twist and bend anything that is stored up in our bodies &#8211; kind of like wringing out a wet towel. Moving and breathing creates more space allowing the energy to move more freely &#8211; almost like a mindful detox. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a quick process, the key to unlocking your emotions takes time if you are open to doing so. Be curious about what you are feeling during your practice. It can be absolutely fascinating as well as healing. Don&#8217;t be put off about the possibility of shedding a tear or two it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Accept yourself and remember that it is perfectly normal to feel however you feel and there is nothing embarrassing about that. </p>
<p>I have included a few poses here to help with emotional connection, so if the prospect of a busy class doesn&#8217;t quite appeal just yet, you can do these poses in the comfort and privacy of your own home and not be at all worried what may come to the surface. Enjoy <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Sun Salutations</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-235" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg" alt="sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sun-salutation-surya-namaskar-a.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Begin by doing a few rounds of <em>Surya Namaskara (sun salutations)</em> to warm up the body.</p>
<p>The forward folds during this short sequence will loosen the hamstrings. Forward folds are linked to letting go of anything negative or stressful you are holding on to &#8211; in particular any feelings of worry or concern. If you are new to sun salutations the diagram to the left shows the different steps. Remember to move while following the breath to get the full benefit of the sequence.</p>
<p>During this warm up, take the time to hold the forward folds for a couple of extra breaths and allow the release of any tightness in the hamstrings &#8211; just let go. </p>
<p><strong>Lizard Pose and Pigeon</strong></p>
<p>Both of these poses are deep stretches for the hips, hamstrings and thighs and help to relax and calm the mind. If you have a knee or hip inflammation you may want to avoid this pose.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-237" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="lizard, pose, sidayoga, yoga, utahan pristhasana" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lizard-pose-sidayoga-utthan-pristhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For<em> Utthan Pristhasana (Lizard Pose)</em> start in Downward Dog, exhale and step the right foot in between the hands making sure that your knee is directly above the ankle. Lower your left knee to the mat. If you have any discomfort in your knee you can either fold your mat to make a more padded surface or use a folded towel or blanket. Move your right foot to the right a few inches and bring your elbows down to the floor inside the right leg on an exhale. If you are having difficulty, place your elbows on a block or remain up on your hands. For a deeper challenge tuck the back toes under and lift the left knee off the floor straightening the leg and extending through the heel. Stay here for 5-10 breaths and then switch sides.</p>
<p>Our hips store emotions such as anger, sadness and frustration and are often tight because we tend to hold on to these feelings. To soften this tightness try softening into the pose. Do not to clench and try to allow yourself to relax and breathe into the sensations. This pose also helps to release tension in the lower back and I have to admit is one of my favourites.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-238" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="pigeon, fold forward, aka raja kapotasana" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pigeon-and-pigeon-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For <em>Eka Pada Raja Kapotasana (Pigeon Pose)</em> begin in Downward Dog and lift the right leg and then on an exhale, bring the right knee to the back of your right wrist and place the shin on the front of the mat. How parallel your shin is to the front of your mat will depend on how open your hips are and how deep you want to go.</p>
<p>The further the heel from the groin the more intense the pose. Extend the left leg behind you and lower your hips to the floor. Keep the right foot flexed to protect the knee. Inhale and press your hands to the floor send your tailbone down and the crown of your head up to the ceiling and lift out of the lower back.</p>
<p>To go deeper, exhale and slowly walk your hands forward to a fold as shown in the picture. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable. I have been known to stay here in my Yin practice for at least five minutes but 5-10 breaths is a great starting point. To come out of the pose inhale and slowly walk the hands back to come up, gently lean towards the right hip as you bring the right leg to the front and give your legs a little shake before repeating on the other side. If this pose is too intense, try using a folded blanket or block underneath the hip on the side where the leg is bent as this will add support.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Forward Fold and Double Seated Pigeon/Fire Log Pose</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-240" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg" alt="dandasana, staff pose, yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dandasana-staff-pose.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />After finishing Pigeon Pose on the left side your legs should be out in front of you after you have given them a little shake after the intensity of the deep stretching. Take a moment in <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>to centre yourself. Feel grounded in the sit bones and try not to slump the body. Sit as straight as possible using the core muscles, press the hands into the floor and reach the crown of the head to the ceiling. Hold for a few breaths. This isn&#8217;t a relaxing pose and does take a fair amount of core strength to sit up straight and not slouch.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-241" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg" alt="paschimottanasana, seated, forward, fold" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-100x100.jpg 100w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-800x800.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paschimottanasana-seated-forward-fold.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Then, when you are ready, on an inhale raise your arms overhead and on an exhale hinge forward from the hips and take a hold of the big toes. Inhale and lengthen the spine and exhale and fold deeper to wherever is comfortable. This is your <em>Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Fold)</em>. You may grab your shins, ankles or toes or use a strap to help with the lengthening of the spine. This pose is great for the lower back muscles and also stretches the hamstrings. Surrender to any feelings of worry and allow yourself to reap the benefits of this truly wonderful pose. To go deeper and if you are really flexible, you can use a yoga block placed in front of the feet and instead of grabbing the foot you can grab the yoga block, but make sure you maintain the integrity of the pose. Stay here for as long as you are comfortable and when you are ready inhale to come back to <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose).</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-242" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg" alt="agnistambhasana, yoga, sida yta, fire log pose" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fire-log-pose-yoga-sidayoga-agnistambhasana.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Next come to Double Seated Pigeon Pose also known as <em>Agnistambhasana (Fire Log Pose)</em>. From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>place your right foot on top of the left knee and move your left foot so it is just below your right knee and keep both feet flexed. This is a deep hip opener and can already feel too much of a challenge. If you are feeling any discomfort just stay with the legs crossed and you can also use a yoga block or folded blanket underneath your hips. Press the fingertips down and inhale to expand the chest then walk the hands coming to a forward fold. Listen to your body and do not go deeper beyond your limit. Stay here for as long as possible and then repeat on the other side with the left foot on top of the right knee and the right foot underneath the left knee.</p>
<p><b>Half Spinal Twist</b></p>
<p>After Fire Log pose take a moment to take the feet to the width of the mat and gently move the knees from side to side much like a wiper blade action. </p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-243" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg" alt="half, spinal twist, arch, matsyendrasana, sida yoga" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-spinal-twist-ardha-matsyendrasana-yoga-sidayoga.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We now come to <em>Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half Spinal Twist). </em>Feel free to take your favourite twist here.  Twisting is great for digestion but also brings the focus to the liver. The liver cleans the blood and stores energy but is also linked to emotions of anger. By twisting, this action of wringing out a wet towel also squeezes and massages away anger.</p>
<p>From <em>Dandasana (Staff Pose) </em>bend your right leg and place the right foot on the floor outside your left knee or thigh. Place the left fingertips on the floor behind you, inhale and reach the left arm up while lengthening the spine. Exhale and bring the left elbow against the outside of your right knee. Inhale and lengthen the spine, exhale and twist turning the abdomen, ribs and chest whilst still keeping the length in the spine. There should be no tension in the shoulders and keep grounding through the sit bones. Remember lengthen on the inhalation, twist deeper on the exhalation. Stay here for 5-10 breaths, release in reverse order, head, shoulders and then abdomen to the front of the space, then repeat on the other side. If you find that your back rounds in this pose, place a blanket underneath your hips. You can also hug the knee rather than placing the elbow on the outside of the knee if the original twist is too intense.</p>
<p>There are of course other poses you can try to help find your emotional connection. You may want to try the Finishing Sequence from the Ashtanga Primary Series. Only attempt this if you are familiar with the sequence or you can try a modified version of each of the poses.</p>
<p>Back bends open the heart and give us energy and courage, while inversions allow us to see the world upside down offering us a different perspective and insight &#8211; a great way to purify the mind and and help calm us when life can be too much sometimes. In my own experience with inversions, I have found them to be extremely overwhelming emotionally. At first I had fear, terrified of falling flat on my face, but then I felt empowered at my ability to balance on a part of my body that was something other than my feet. A great way to build confidence if you just keep practising. Remember, it&#8217;s all about the journey not the destination <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a ballet dancer, I always thought when it came to alignment in yoga I would nail it, no question. I&#8217;d spent years practicing my &#8216;good toes, naughty toes&#8217; and perfecting my posture in class so figured I had it down. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I took my first alignment class in Shanghai did I realise that it was so much more than having decent posture and looking pretty. I felt I was taking yoga to another level once I started to understand my body a bit more and could then attempt postures and &#8216;feel&#8217; the pose rather than just &#8216;doing&#8217; the pose. Something I wish I had understood a little better when practising ballet &#8211; my grand jete certainly would have had more oomph that&#8217;s for sure!</p>
<p>Alignment was also far more challenging than I expected it to be. Classes involved holding poses for a longer period of time in order to feel and connect to the pose on a deeper level. We would use blocks, yoga straps and the wall to help align our bodies, particularly for some of the standing postures and it was eye-opening to discover that up until that point I hadn&#8217;t been opening my body as much as I could or engaging my muscles properly.</p>
<p>So what is alignment? Alignment alone is a collection of instructions for every pose where the body is positioned in a certain way that allows you to then experience the full benefit of the pose while avoiding injury, promoting balance and improving posture and strength. Different yoga styles have their own views on alignment so it can be a rather confusing topic. Every person&#8217;s body is different and therefore so is each person&#8217;s alignment. What can appear as a prescribed list of requirements for a pose will not work for everyone. Therefore, the aim is to guide students into a pose that they can perform to the best of their ability and ultimately reach a solid foundation as well as a deeper understanding of how their body works and whether or not the next stage of a pose is accessible. It&#8217;s all about the journey, not the destination.</p>
<p>For me, this is rather humbling and took me a while to accept. Flicking through thousands of pictures on Instagram getting frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t balance on one hand and press to handstand overnight. As a dancer I was always blessed with flexibility and naturally open hips seem to run in my family, but as any normal person I was annoyed that what I had in flexibility I lacked in core strength. As I started to focus more on alignment and as I discovered during my teacher training through the guidance of two wonderful teachers, I discovered that what was most important in my practice was the actual process. As long as I was paying attention to instructions and focusing on a few core concepts and the purpose of each asana, progression to the next stage was something I could decide for myself and that was a really cool experience for me. A lot like having the stabilisers on your bike taken off for the first time and then being able to go anywhere. Liberating!</p>
<p>When we talk about anatomy and yoga it all seems so obvious. Rather than be put off by this idea of perfection we can relax in the knowledge that what is perfect for one person may not be the same for another. By focusing on developing awareness, alignment becomes something that is far easier to understand and accomplish. </p>
<p>During my training, I was introduced to &#8216;Proprioception&#8217;. This is the body&#8217;s ability to know it&#8217;s position without actually looking. It is the perception of yourself in space and therefore a cognitive process. The proprioceptors in our muscles are sensitive to stretching and help us in yoga to develop our body awareness.  Proprioception can be developed with practice. By taking the time to observe your position when performing a pose and using the breath to synchronise movement, our proprioceptive sensors are activated and this allows the body to balance itself in its environment. These simple techniques allow us to strengthen our body&#8217;s response system and results in better placement, posture and alignment.</p>
<p>Developing your proprioception can sometimes be super hard. I picked up a handy tip during my training which I have since found invaluable for helping my alignment and how my body feels in a particular position. Grab a Sharpie and using a decent ruler, draw a line down the centre of your mat. I know, I know, I too was initially horrified at the idea of defacing my otherwise sparkly Lululemon mat but trust me it will help. That simple line will help you when lining up your heels in standing poses, squaring your hips and placing your hands for Plank or Downward dog and so much more. </p>

<p>Shifting focus on how a pose feels rather than how it looks is the aim of the game. I love using props in my practice as I find they help to open up the body more and support safe alignment. I know many students who get put off using props feeling that they are only for beginners, but this is simply not true. Yoga blocks and straps help to create length and space in the body and allow us to access the correct muscles when verbal guides are not enough.</p>
<p>When I first started my yoga journey, phrases like &#8216;lift your knee caps&#8217;, &#8216;tuck your tailbone&#8217; and &#8216;engage your core&#8217; left me bewildered. I&#8217;m not really one of those people who is too proud to ask a question when I am stuck even if there is a risk I might look a bit stupid, so one day I just asked. I was lucky to have such a wonderful down-to-earth teacher who reassured me I wasn&#8217;t alone in my seemingly simple questions. </p>
<p>I was told to sit in Dandasana with my feet against the wall. I was then told to contract my quadriceps by drawing my thigh muscles up as if I was standing strong in Tadasana. From this simple exercise I could see my knee caps lift and realised it was all about my thigh muscles and I was getting all caught up in what my knees were doing and it was all about engaging my thighs. This is so important in yoga as it helps to protect the knee from hyperextension. Keeping this in mind, standing poses immediately become stronger and more solid and of course safer. </p>
<p>&#8216;Tucking the tailbone&#8217; can be quite misleading. Like our bodies, the position of the pelvis is also different from person to person. Whether the pelvis tilt is anterior, posterior or neutral, the cue to tuck the tailbone just won&#8217;t work for everyone. Instead, by drawing the hips towards one another, the belly in and up and the tailbone down the leg muscles strengthen and the lower back is protected. The pelvis feels balanced and the core is strengthened. </p>
<p>The core and understanding all the muscles attached to it requires a post in its own right, but for now I will attempt to put it in a way that is a little less puzzling. When we engage our core we want to support and stabilise the spine. When done correctly it feels like having something tight like a corset or a belt wrapped around your waist. Pull the muscle around your waist towards the midline to try and get that feeling. Lastly, you want to tighten the pelvic floor muscles up towards your navel. Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from going to the toilet. All our movements are initiated from an engaged core. It can be a weird feeling so a handy tip would be to try this when not exercising. While waiting for the kettle to boil or brushing your teeth, get your body used to this hugged in feeling and then when you get on the mat engaging your core will feel more natural.</p>
<p>There are also a number of other alignment cues you can incorporate into your practice, and while I don&#8217;t expect anyone to remember all of them having some idea of just a few of the principles will make your practice easier and far more effective. Your foundation will be stronger, you will become aligned with gravity, have more energy and use less effort to do poses that currently seem out of reach. </p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-124" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg" alt="monk feet yoga alignment rose petal" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-300x200.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-400x267.jpg 400w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-800x533.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monk-feet-alignment-rose-petals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />During a class always think about your feet. We always hear teachers telling us to ground our feet but what that actually means is distribute your weight evenly into all four corners of the feet which are your inner and outer heel, your big toe mound and your pinky toe mound. To get a good feel for what we are aiming for here, stand in Tadasana. Lift all your toes, and then the area on the ball of your foot underneath the big toe feel that area press downwards and back towards your inner heel. Then do the same with the area underneath your pinky toes, pushing downwards and back towards your outer heels. Then allow the rest of the toes to come down to the floor. The point of this is to feel the arches lift and activate the legs. You will notice how much more grounded and stable you are. If you are not grounded, it is very hard to maintain a solid and spacious pose.</p>
<p>The same also applies when placing our hands. Fingers should be spread wide pointing forwards and the pads underneath our knuckles should press firmly into the mat as well as your fingertips. Do not collapse into the heels of your hands as this will put unnecessary strain on your wrists. You want to imagine you are creating a suction pad with your hands which will then help to support the weight you can put on your hands particularly in arm balancing poses.</p>
<p>We are always looking for space in our asanas. We never want to feel bunched up or like areas of our body are collapsing into other parts of our body. We want to be always lengthening from our spine (unless specifically instructed to do otherwise), softening our shoulders to avoid tension and keeping our necks long. As a teacher, the amount of times I see students collapsing in poses like Trikonasana just because they want to touch the floor, forgetting the point of the asana. Use your blocks, that&#8217;s what they are there for to help you find space in a pose.</p>
<p>Lastly, but by no means least focus on the breath. The breath is energetically nourishing the anatomical posture and therefore should be our primary focus. Aligning our breath with our movement allows us to move a little easier through the poses. Our minds become quiet which means our focus increases.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-123" src="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg" alt="sidayoga yoga buddha body mind spirit" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-300x169.jpg 300w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-800x450.jpg 800w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://content.sidayoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yoga-buddha-body-mind-spirit-sidayoga.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When practising yoga, all the asanas should work for you in a good way and not cause any pain or discomfort. Make sure to inform your teacher of any injuries and remember a class is not a posture race. Use the verbal cues from your teacher as a guide to reach a deeper connection with a pose and don&#8217;t be afraid to use any props that are available to you. As soon as one stage of a pose becomes easy, understand when your body is ready to move on or go deeper, but take your time. Alignment may appear to be physically focused but the mind&#8217;s role is just as important. Alignment of the body, mind and spirit will mean your practice will become stronger, more steady and ultimately more relaxed. </p>
